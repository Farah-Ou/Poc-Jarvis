-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization, framework, dimension, initiative, stakeholder, community, partnership, technology, sustainability, value, report, training, program, strategy, goal, impact, client, employee, supplier, market, performance, certification, standard, culture, ethics, diversity, inclusion, business, economy]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into English, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

share and assess the progress toward our shared 
goals and achievements across these dimensions.

Accenture 3600Value Report 2024 
Listening creates better experiences 
We are listening more, and more often, to our clients, 
using surveys and project-based feedback tools to 
augment our daily interactions. We want to understand 
our clients’ expectations and their perceptions across 
key performance areas such as loyalty, relationships, 
value generation, innovation, delivery and ease of doing 
business. We then communicate our assessment, 
including data and insights, and plan actions to create 
even stronger relationships. 
We believe this approach creates deeper partnerships 
and ongoing opportunities to make a profound positive 
impact on our clients’ business, their employees and 
customers, and the communities where they operate. 
Collaborating with our clients 
We co-create with our clients to help drive 360° value, 
including aligning on the list of value outcomes and 
strategic priorities they are seeking to achieve. 
We also co-invest with our clients to help maximize 
business outcomes. This can include establishing 
an innovation fund; creating a new asset; identifying 
opportunities for value-sharing; supporting training 
for our clients’ people in new skills and capabilities; 
and staffing additional Accenture resources. 
We collaborate to make a greater 
positive impact on the world 
Our focus on shared success with our clients extends 
to our shared values. Our clients and partners are also 
committed to skilling, and we are proud of the ways we 
amplify our impact when we team with them to do 
more, together. 
Pioneering Clean Energy Jobs in Houston's Hydrogen

 core, such as moving them to 
the cloud, leveraging data and AI, and embedding 
security across the enterprise. 
• Optimizing their operations, such as helping our 
clients digitize faster, access digital talent and reduce 
costs, as well as through digitizing engineering and 
manufacturing. 
• Accelerating their revenue growth, such as 
through using technology and creativity to create 
personalized connections, experiences and targeted 
sales at scale; leveraging data and AI; transforming 
content supply chains and marketing and commerce 
models; and helping create new digital services and 
business models. 
We invest in data and AI to help 
accelerate our clients' reinvention 
In June 2023, we announced an industry-leading 
investment of $3 billion in data & AI by the end of fiscal 
2026 to help our clients across all industries rapidly and 
responsibly advance and use AI to achieve greater 
growth, efficiency and resilience. 
We believe AI is the new digital. Like digital, AI is both a 
technology and a new way of working, and its full value 
will only come from strategies built on both productivity 
and growth. And we believe it will be used in every part 
of the enterprise. The introduction of generative AI 
signifies a transformative era that is set to drive growth 
for us and our clients. 
Data will continue to be essential to building the digital 
core. We expect that the work to prepare enterprise 
data, which is the fuel for AI, will be an increasing part 
of our growth. 
We also continue to steadily increase our Data & AI 
workforce, reaching approximately 57,000 skilled 
Data & AI practitioners at the end of fiscal 2024, 
against our goal of doubling our Data & AI workforce 
to 80,000 by the end of fiscal 2026. 
In addition to bringing generative AI innovation to our 
clients, we are embedding it into how we deliver our 
services and in how we operate—all underpinned by 
our Responsible AI compliance program. 
We help clients focus on talent to 
accomplish reinvention and take 
advantage of AI 
This includes helping clients to access the best people 
at the right time, place and cost; to become a talent 
creator to keep their people market-relevant; and to 
unlock the potential of their talent. 
This year we launched LearnVantage, our 
comprehensive technology learning and training 
services that help our clients reskill and upskill their 
people so they can be a talent creator. 
We help connect sustainability to 
reinvention 
As our clients reinvent, we believe that trends such as 
sustainability will continue to be forces behind their 
need to reinvent and the outcomes of their 
reinventions. Together with our ecosystem partners, 
we help our clients define, measure and achieve their 
environmental, social and governance goals by 
connecting sustainability with their transformation 
agendas across their strategy and operations to make 
their value chains more sustainable.

our clients 
Our 360° Value Meter helps our clients become 
the next and best versions of themselves by 
having more complete and meaningful 
conversations on value.

than 600 Accenture clients worldwide to monitor 
and measure the value we are creating together.
