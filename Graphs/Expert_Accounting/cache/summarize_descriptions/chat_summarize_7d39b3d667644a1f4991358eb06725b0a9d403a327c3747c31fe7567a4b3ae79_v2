This term encapsulates the concept of income that has been received by an entity before the corresponding goods or services have been delivered to the purchaser. In essence, it represents a liability on the company's balance sheet because it is an obligation to provide goods or services in the future. The recognition of \"Produits Constatés d'Avance\" is crucial for adhering to the matching principle in accounting, which mandates that revenues be matched with the expenses incurred in earning them within the same accounting period. Therefore, even though the payment is received in advance, the income is not recognized immediately as revenue but is instead deferred until the delivery of goods or services. This ensures that the financial statements accurately reflect the company's financial position and performance by not overstating revenue or profit in periods prior to the fulfillment of the service or delivery of goods.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296114, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 193, "prompt_tokens": 168, "total_tokens": 361, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
