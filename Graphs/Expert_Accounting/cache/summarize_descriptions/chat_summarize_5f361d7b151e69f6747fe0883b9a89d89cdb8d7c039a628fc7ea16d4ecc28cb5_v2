According to the decree, producers have the option to fulfill their obligations regarding waste management by joining an approved organization. This arrangement involves producers paying a financial contribution to an authorized (or approved) organization, which then undertakes the responsibility for waste management services on their behalf. This financial contribution is considered an operating expense for the producers. The relationship between PRODUCTEUR and ORGANISME AGRÉÉ is thus characterized by a financial transaction where the producers fund the waste management services provided by the approved organization, ensuring compliance with regulatory obligations.
