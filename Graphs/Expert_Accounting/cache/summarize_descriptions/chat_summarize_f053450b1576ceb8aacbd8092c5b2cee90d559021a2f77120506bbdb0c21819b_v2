This includes the treatment of advertising services performed on the internet, which are part of the broader scope of exchange transactions covered by the directive.

Let's address the missed entities and their relationships based on the provided text and the specified entity types (organization, person, geo, event).Given the constraints of the task and the information provided in the text, it appears there were limitations in identifying specific named entities directly correlating to the types: organization, person, geo, event, beyond those initially identified. The text primarily discusses accounting standards and procedures in France, focusing on technical aspects of accounting practices rather than mentioning specific organizations, geographical locations, persons, or events in a manner that fits the criteria for extraction.The text does reference \\\"transactions internet\\\" and \\\"prestation publicitaire effectuée sur internet\\\" which could be interpreted as part of broader events or organizational activities related to internet advertising and online transactions. However, without specific names or identifiers, these references do not directly translate into extractable entities as per the instructions.Additionally, the text mentions \\\"entreprises en redressement judiciaire\\\" (companies in judicial reorganization) and \\\"transactions d’échange\\\" (exchange transactions) which could imply the involvement of organizations and possibly events (judicial reorganization processes, exchange transactions) but again, without specific names, these references remain too generic for direct extraction under the given entity types.For a more accurate extraction, the text would need to contain explicit mentions of organizations (by name), persons (by name), geographical locations (by name), or events (with specific titles or dates) that can be directly extracted and described.In summary, while the text provides a rich context for understanding certain aspects of French accounting practices, it does not offer specific enough information to extract additional entities under the provided categories beyond the initial extraction without making broad assumptions or inferences that go beyond the text's explicit content.\", \"An advisory note related to the accounting treatment of exchange activities in internet transactions\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_summarize_f053450b1576ceb8aacbd8092c5b2cee90d559021a2f77120506bbdb0c21819b_v2"}
