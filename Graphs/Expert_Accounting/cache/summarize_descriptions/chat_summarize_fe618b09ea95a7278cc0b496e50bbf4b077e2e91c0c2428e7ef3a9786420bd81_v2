This category is a crucial part of a company's financial assets, highlighting the money that customers or debtors are expected to pay to the company. In essence, CRÉANCES includes customer accounts, which are amounts due from clients for goods sold or services rendered on credit terms, as well as other receivables that might arise in the course of business operations. These other receivables can include loans to employees, advances to suppliers, or any other form of financial claims that the company holds against external parties. As a fundamental component of a company's balance sheet, CRÉANCES play a significant role in managing the company's cash flow and assessing its financial health.
