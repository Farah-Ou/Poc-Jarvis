This financial metric is crucial in the context of joint ventures, where it represents the participants' respective shares in the outcomes of collaborative business activities. Specifically, this share of result is recorded under account 655, a designation used to track the participation in losses or the distribution of profits arising from joint operations. The accounting practice surrounding this concept ensures that each entity involved in a joint venture accurately reflects its share of the financial results—whether profits or losses—in its financial statements.
