Specifically, Article 746-1 addresses the treatment of mergers without share exchange in the accounts of the holding entities. This involves detailing the methods and practices that should be followed to accurately reflect the financial implications of such mergers, ensuring that the financial statements of the absorbing or receiving entities provide a true and fair view of the merger's impact.

However, based on the provided text and the instructions to only emit entities that match the previously extracted types (organization, person, geo, event), and considering the nature of the text which primarily discusses accounting principles and regulations without mentioning specific organizations, persons, geographical locations, or events beyond regulatory articles, it appears that the initial extraction correctly identified the relevant entities according to the specified entity types.The text primarily revolves around accounting standards and regulations, specifically dealing with \\\"mali technique\\\" and its treatment in various scenarios as per French accounting standards. The entities extracted are centered around these regulations (articles and the collection of standards themselves), which are categorized under \\\"organization\\\" for the collection of standards and \\\"event\\\" for the articles/regulations due to their impact on accounting practices.If there were specific organizations (beyond the general reference to accounting standards), persons, geographical locations, or distinct events mentioned in the text that were overlooked and fit the entity types of organization, person, geo, or event, I would need more specific details from the text to identify and extract them accurately.
