This category includes interest charges, which are costs incurred from borrowing funds, and discounts granted, which are reductions in price given to customers, reflecting a financial cost to the company. Additionally, CHARGES FINANCIÈRES covers financial exchange losses, which arise from unfavorable changes in exchange rates affecting the value of foreign currency transactions. Moreover, this category accounts for net charges on disposals of various financial assets, capturing losses from the sale or write-off of these assets.\n\nNotably, CHARGES FINANCIÈRES also includes financial expenses not recorded under account 66, a specific designation in the French accounting system, indicating that it encompasses a broader range of financial costs beyond those traditionally classified under this account. These expenses extend to amortizations and depreciations, which are methods of allocating the cost of tangible and intangible assets over their useful lives, reflecting the consumption of the asset's economic benefits. Provisions, another component, are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount, set aside for future obligations that are probable and can be estimated.\n\nInterest charges, as previously mentioned, form a core part of CHARGES FINANCIÈRES, alongside losses on financial instruments, which may include derivatives, debt securities, and equity instruments that have decreased in value. The category further includes depreciation related to financial assets, reinforcing the impact of asset value reduction over time on financial expenses. Provisions, whether for bad debts, litigation, or other potential liabilities, also play a significant role in financial charges, preparing the company for future financial outflows.\n\nMoreover, CHARGES FINANCIÈRES captures negative currency exchange differences, which occur when the value of foreign currency transactions decreases due to exchange rate movements, and losses from the disposal of financial assets, highlighting the financial impact of selling or writing off investments and other financial instruments at a loss.\n\nIn summary, CHARGES FINANCIÈRES represents a comprehensive category of financial expenses in French accounting, covering a wide array of costs from interest charges and discounts granted to depreciation, provisions, and losses from financial transactions and asset disposals. This category is essential for accurately reflecting a company's financial expenses and understanding its overall financial position.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296121, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 476, "prompt_tokens": 247, "total_tokens": 723, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
