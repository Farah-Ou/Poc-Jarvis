This category is not limited to but includes essential financial elements such as social capital, investment grants recorded as equity, capital reserves, and profits that have not been distributed. The term itself is indicative of the equity and similar financial components that are foundational to the financial structuring and reporting within organizations operating under French accounting standards. CAPITAUX PROPRES is integral in illustrating an organization's financial health and stability, as it accounts for the core financial resources that are owned by the company's shareholders after all liabilities have been subtracted. This comprehensive understanding of CAPITAUX PROPRES highlights its significance in assessing the financial robustness and operational sustainability of entities, by providing a clear snapshot of the equity capital, inclusive of the contributions made by shareholders or owners, the accumulation of undistributed profits over time, and any grants that have been received and recorded as equity. This amalgamation of financial elements under CAPITAUX PROPRES is pivotal for stakeholders to gauge the financial viability and strategic direction of an entity within the realms of French accounting practices.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296044, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 227, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 414, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
