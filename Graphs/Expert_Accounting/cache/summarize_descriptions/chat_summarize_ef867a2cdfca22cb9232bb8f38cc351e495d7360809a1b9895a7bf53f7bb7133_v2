This initiative rewards entities for undertaking actions or making acquisitions that result in energy savings. These certificates serve as a means for companies to document the energy savings they have achieved. The management of these certificates operates under two primary economic models: \"Économies d'énergie\" (Energy Savings) and \"Négoce\" (Trading). Through these models, the CEE system facilitates a structured approach to promoting energy efficiency and sustainability within the French economy, allowing businesses to participate actively in the country's energy conservation efforts. This system not only incentivizes but also quantifies energy-saving measures, playing a crucial role in France's broader strategy to reduce energy consumption and mitigate environmental impact.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296084, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 170, "prompt_tokens": 219, "total_tokens": 389, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
