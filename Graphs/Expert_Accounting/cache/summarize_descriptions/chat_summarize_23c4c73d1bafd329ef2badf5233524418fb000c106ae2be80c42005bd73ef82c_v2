The text primarily discusses accounting principles, provisions, liabilities, and financial reporting requirements without specific references to identifiable entities such as specific organizations, persons, geographical locations, or events that can be extracted with comprehensive descriptions of their attributes and activities.The initial extraction focused on the document itself as an organizational entity due to its nature as a collection of accounting standards. Without specific names, places, or events mentioned beyond the context of accounting practices, further extraction based on the provided text would not yield additional entities or relationships as per the guidelines.If there were specific organizations, persons, geographical locations, or events mentioned within the context of these accounting standards (e.g., named entities responsible for the creation of the standards, specific geographical areas where the standards apply, or specific events related to the implementation of these standards), those could be extracted as entities. However, the provided text excerpt does not contain such information.For accurate extraction, detailed content mentioning specific organizations, individuals, locations, or events is required.
