These entities operate under a unique framework that subjects them to specific accounting rules and operational practices, which significantly influence their financial statements. Their primary mission is to offer affordable housing options to individuals and families in need, ensuring that everyone has access to safe and secure living conditions.\n\nIn addition to their general role in social housing, these organizations are approved to function as Organismes de Foncier Solidaire (OFS). As OFS, they are authorized to provide housing through a real solidarity lease (Bail RÃ©el Solidaire or BRS) scheme. This innovative leasing model is designed to promote housing affordability and accessibility, further emphasizing the social mission of these entities. The BRS scheme allows households to benefit from secure, long-term housing at reduced costs, thereby supporting social inclusion and community stability.\n\nOverall, Organismes de Logement Social play a crucial role in the social housing sector, guided by a commitment to solidarity and the well-being of underprivileged populations.
