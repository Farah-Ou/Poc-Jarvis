This agency is specifically responsible for defining and implementing actions that contribute to energy savings, which are crucial for the environmental and economic health of France. The DGEC's work involves the creation and management of Energy Savings Certificates (CEEs), a key tool in the country's energy policy framework. These certificates are issued following the successful completion of energy-saving actions, which are detailed through standardized operation sheets or tailored to individual procedures for specific operations. By doing so, the DGEC not only promotes the reduction of energy consumption but also incentivizes organizations and individuals to undertake measures that contribute to the broader goals of energy efficiency and climate change mitigation. Through its pivotal role, the DGEC is at the forefront of France's commitment to a sustainable and energy-efficient future.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296085, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 192, "prompt_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 399, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
