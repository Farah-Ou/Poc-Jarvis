The regulation is part of the \"RECUEIL DES NORMES COMPTABLES FRANÇAISES,\" which serves as a comprehensive collection of French accounting standards. The primary focus of Article 122-2 is to ensure that companies transitioning to or adopting specific accounting practices under French regulations do so with transparency and accountability, providing clear justification for any methodological shifts and evaluating the potential impacts these changes may have on their financial reporting and overall financial health.

However, based on the provided text and the instructions, the entities extracted were aligned with the specified entity types: organization, person, geo, and event. The text primarily discusses articles and regulations related to French accounting standards, which were categorized under the \\\"event\\\" type due to their nature as specific regulatory events or guidelines.The text does not explicitly mention any organizations, persons, or geographical locations beyond the scope of the \\\"RECUEIL DES NORMES COMPTABLES FRANÇAISES,\\\" which was identified as an organization. Similarly, no specific individuals or geographical locations were mentioned that would fit the criteria for \\\"person\\\" or \\\"geo\\\" entity types.Given the nature of the text, which is highly technical and regulatory, the primary focus was on identifying the articles (events) that dictate accounting practices. If there were expectations to identify more nuanced or indirectly referenced entities within those categories without explicit mentions in the text, such as specific organizations affected by these regulations, specific persons involved in the creation or enforcement of these regulations, or specific geographical locations where these regulations apply, those were not directly extractable from the provided text based on the instructions.If there are specific entities or relationships within the framework of the provided text that you believe have been missed and should be extracted according to the guidelines, could you please clarify or provide additional context? This would help in refining the extraction to meet your expectations.\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_summarize_42c417182c8e6457cac04ce3056c5596bc6156e5025fdcfc4ee00582245f70ca_v2"}
