This article focuses on the valuation of interchangeable items in inventory, providing guidance on how these items should be accounted for in financial records. It details various cost methods that can be applied to determine the value of inventory, including the cost of the previous period's closing stock, the cost of purchases, production costs, and recognized accounting methods such as the weighted average cost or FIFO (First In, First Out). Additionally, ART. 213-34 addresses the cost entry method for interchangeable items within each category after they have been stored, ensuring that businesses have a clear framework for inventory valuation.
