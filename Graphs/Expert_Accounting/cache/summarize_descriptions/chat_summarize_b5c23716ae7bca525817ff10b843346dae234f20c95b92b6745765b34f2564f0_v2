This regulation is crucial for businesses and accountants as it provides a clear framework for determining when an asset is considered impaired and thus subject to depreciation. According to Article 214-17, once an asset is deemed impaired due to factors such as decreased market value or adverse changes in the business environment that affect the asset's profitability or utility, the depreciation of these commercial funds is acknowledged in the financial statements. Importantly, this article stipulates that there is no possibility of depreciation recovery for assets affected in this manner. This means that once an asset's value is written down, the loss cannot be reversed in the financial records, even if the asset's value later recovers. This provision ensures that the financial statements accurately reflect the economic realities facing the asset at the time of impairment, providing a more conservative and realistic view of a company's financial health.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296062, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 202, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 395, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
