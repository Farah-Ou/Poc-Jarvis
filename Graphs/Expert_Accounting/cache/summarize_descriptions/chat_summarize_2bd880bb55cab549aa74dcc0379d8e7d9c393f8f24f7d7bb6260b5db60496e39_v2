It specifically addresses the use of useful life for creating amortization schedules for both tangible and intangible assets. This article is essential for businesses and financial entities as it outlines the guidelines on how to systematically reduce the value of these assets over time for accounting and tax purposes. By providing a framework for the calculation of depreciation, Article 214-13 ensures that companies can accurately reflect the wearing out, consumption, or other reductions in the useful life of their physical and non-physical assets. This, in turn, affects financial statements and tax liabilities, making it a critical piece of legislation for financial planning and compliance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296063, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 146, "prompt_tokens": 176, "total_tokens": 322, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
