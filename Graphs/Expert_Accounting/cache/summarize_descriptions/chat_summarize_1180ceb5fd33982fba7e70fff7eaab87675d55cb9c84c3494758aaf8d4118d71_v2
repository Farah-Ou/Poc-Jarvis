These accounts are comprehensive documents that include several key components: the balance sheet, the income statement, and an annex. The inclusion of these components is not arbitrary but is mandated by specific regulations that govern financial reporting and accountability. The balance sheet provides a snapshot of the entity's financial position at a particular point in time, detailing assets, liabilities, and equity. The income statement, on the other hand, offers a summary of the entity's financial performance over a certain period, highlighting revenue, expenses, and profit or loss. The annex serves as a supplementary document, providing additional details and explanations that are crucial for a full understanding of the financial statements. The requirement to prepare and present COMPTES ANNUELS is rooted in the need for transparency and accountability, ensuring that stakeholders, including investors, creditors, and regulatory bodies, have access to accurate and comprehensive financial information. This practice is governed by specific regulations that outline the models and formats entities must use, ensuring consistency and comparability across different entities' financial statements.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296054, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 232, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 418, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
