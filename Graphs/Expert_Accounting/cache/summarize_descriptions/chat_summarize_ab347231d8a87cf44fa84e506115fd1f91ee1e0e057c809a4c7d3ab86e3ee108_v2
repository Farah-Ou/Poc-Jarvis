These assets encompass land, buildings, machinery, and other tangible items that the entity owns and uses in its daily activities. The accounting events associated with immobilisations corporelles include their acquisition, which marks the initial recognition of these assets on the entity's balance sheet. Following acquisition, these assets undergo amortization and depreciation processes. Amortization applies to the systematic reduction in value of intangible assets, while depreciation specifically relates to the gradual decrease in value of physical assets over time due to use, wear and tear, or obsolescence. This depreciation is a critical aspect of accounting for immobilisations corporelles, as it reflects the real-world diminishing utility of these assets, allowing entities to accurately represent their value on financial statements. Collectively, immobilisations corporelles are a fundamental part of the entity's heritage, representing significant long-term investments that contribute to the entity's operational capacity and overall value.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296115, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 207, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 400, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
