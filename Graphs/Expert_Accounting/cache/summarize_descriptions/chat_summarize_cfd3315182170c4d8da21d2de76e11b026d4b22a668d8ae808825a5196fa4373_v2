Both entities are involved in providing two main types of subsidies: subventions d'exploitation, which are operational subsidies designed to cover or assist with the day-to-day operational costs of public services or organizations, and subventions d’investissement, which are investment subsidies aimed at funding long-term capital projects or investments that contribute to the development or enhancement of public infrastructure, services, or capabilities.\n\nTheir cooperative efforts extend beyond the provision of subsidies, encompassing the administration of taxes, subsidies, and public funds. This collaboration ensures that the financial resources collected through taxation and other means are effectively allocated and managed, supporting the sustainable development and maintenance of public services and infrastructure. The partnership between ÉTAT and COLLECTIVITÉS PUBLIQUES is fundamental to the economic and social well-being of the public sector, facilitating the efficient and effective delivery of services to the public, as well as the strategic investment in future projects that will benefit society as a whole.
