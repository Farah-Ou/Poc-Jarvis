It provides a detailed framework for understanding how assets should be accounted for, particularly emphasizing the treatment of expenditures. The article clarifies that not all expenditures directly increase future economic benefits; however, it specifies that such expenditures are still necessary for obtaining these benefits. This distinction is crucial for accountants and financial professionals as it guides them in accurately recognizing and categorizing assets on the balance sheet. By delineating the conditions under which assets are recognized, ART. 212-1 plays a pivotal role in ensuring that financial statements accurately reflect the economic reality of an entity.
