It mandates that no provision should be recognized in exceptional cases where the obligation amount cannot be reliably estimated. This regulation plays a crucial role in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of financial statements by preventing the recognition of uncertain liabilities. By stipulating that provisions can only be recognized when the obligation amount is estimable with reliability, Article 322-4 helps maintain the integrity of financial reporting and ensures that entities do not arbitrarily recognize or fail to recognize financial obligations. This contributes to the overall transparency and trustworthiness of financial disclosures under the legal accounting framework.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296075, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 125, "prompt_tokens": 174, "total_tokens": 299, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
