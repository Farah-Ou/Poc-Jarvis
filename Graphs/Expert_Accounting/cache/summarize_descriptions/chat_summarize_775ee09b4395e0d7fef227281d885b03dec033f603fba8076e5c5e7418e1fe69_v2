VEFA, a common practice in French real estate, involves purchasing property before it is fully constructed. According to the guidelines provided in the Recueil des Normes Comptables Françaises, the accounting for VEFA contracts should be recognized either at the completion of the construction or progressively, depending on the progress of the construction work. This approach ensures that the financial statements accurately reflect the current status of the construction project and the financial obligations of the parties involved. The document serves as a crucial reference for accountants and financial professionals involved in VEFA transactions, ensuring consistency and transparency in the accounting practices related to these types of real estate deals in France.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296173, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 185, "prompt_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 381, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
