These assets, distinct from tangible assets like machinery or buildings, include intellectual property, software, patents, and licenses. The management of these assets encompasses their acquisition, which is the initial recording of the asset's value on the company's balance sheet, followed by their amortization and depreciation. Amortization is specifically applied to these intangible assets, spreading their cost over their useful life to reflect the consumption of the asset over time. This process is crucial for accurately representing the company's financial health and operational efficiency, as it ensures that the expenses associated with acquiring and using these intangible assets are matched with the revenue they help generate. Depreciation, while more commonly associated with tangible assets, is also a relevant concept for certain types of intangible assets that have a definable useful life, indicating the reduction in value of these assets as they approach the end of their usability or legal rights. IMMOBILISATIONS INCORPORELLES, therefore, plays a significant role in the financial accounting and reporting of entities, highlighting the importance of non-physical assets in modern business operations and the need for meticulous management of their value over time.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296114, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 259, "prompt_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 447, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
