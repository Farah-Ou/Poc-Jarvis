This encompasses production costs that are capitalized, meaning they are not expensed in the period they are incurred but are instead treated as part of the entity's assets. This accounting practice allows the entity to spread the cost of the production over its useful life, reflecting the consumption of the asset's value over time. Essentially, \"PRODUCTION IMMOBILISÉE\" represents an investment in the entity's own operational capabilities or infrastructure, which is expected to provide economic benefits in future periods. This approach aligns with the principle of matching expenses with the revenue they help to generate, ensuring that financial statements accurately represent the entity's financial position and performance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296128, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 167, "prompt_tokens": 176, "total_tokens": 343, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
