Let's identify additional entities and relationships based on the provided text and the specified entity types (organization, person, geo, event).Entities:- No additional entities matching the specified types (organization, person, geo, event) were described in detail in the provided text excerpt. The text primarily discusses accounting principles and guidelines without mentioning specific organizations (beyond \\\"RECUEIL DES NORMES COMPTABLES FRANÇAISES\\\"), persons, geographical locations, or events (beyond \\\"AVIS CNC N°99-10\\\") in a context that would allow for a detailed description as per the instructions.Relationships:- The text does not provide explicit information on relationships between entities like organizations, persons, geographical locations, or specific events beyond the general context of accounting standards and practices. The entities identified do not have a clear, direct relationship with each other based on the information provided in the text excerpt.Given the nature of the text, which is focused on accounting standards and practices, it inherently lacks the specificity required to identify a broader range of entities and their relationships beyond the general guidelines and directives for accounting for long-term contracts.If there were more context or additional text provided that included specific organizations, persons, geographical locations, or events, further entities and relationships could potentially be identified and extracted according to the given instructions.<|COMPLETE|>\", \"An advisory note from September 23, 1999, related to long-term contracts\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_summarize_25c433970545cac8231906bfbc8d7affa09b4111911e0de41aa65ecbe290de43_v2"}
