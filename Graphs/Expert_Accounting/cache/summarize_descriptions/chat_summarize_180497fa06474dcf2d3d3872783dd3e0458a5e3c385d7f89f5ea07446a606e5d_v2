It specifically outlines the modalities for asset impairment, providing guidance on how to assess and account for the decrease in value of assets affected by what is termed as \"mali technique.\" This term refers to the technical obsolescence or physical deterioration that leads to a reduction in the utility and, consequently, the value of an asset. The regulation mandates that assets must be evaluated for impairment by comparing their current value to their net book value. If the current value, which reflects the fair market price or the value in use of the asset, is found to be lower than the net book value, an impairment loss must be recognized. This process ensures that the financial statements of a company accurately reflect the real economic value of its assets, thereby providing stakeholders with a truthful view of the company's financial health. Article 214-15 is essential for companies operating under French accounting standards, as it guides them in making necessary adjustments to their financial statements, ensuring transparency and compliance with the regulatory framework governing financial reporting in France.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296062, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 230, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 417, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
