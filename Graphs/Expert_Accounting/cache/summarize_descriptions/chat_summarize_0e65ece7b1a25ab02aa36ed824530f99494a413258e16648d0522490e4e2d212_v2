It serves as a set of accounting guidelines and principles that dictate the financial recording and reporting practices for entities operating within the country. This framework includes detailed instructions on the treatment of tax credits, investment subsidies, and how operating grants are accounted for, ensuring that financial transactions are recorded consistently and financial statements are prepared accurately.\n\nThe PCG is mandated by the Autorité des Normes Comptables (ANC), with significant modifications introduced through regulation ANC n° 2014-03 and later updates, such as the modification by the ANC regulation n° 2017-03. These regulations have been established to guide entities in maintaining their accounting records according to the latest standards, including guidelines for financial reporting and maintenance provisions.\n\nAs a regulatory framework governing accounting standards in France, the PCG is referenced by its articles, which are integral to understanding and applying the accounting principles and standards within the French context. It is designed to ensure that businesses operate under a uniform set of rules, facilitating clarity, consistency, and comparability across financial statements.\n\nIn summary, the Plan Comptable Général is the cornerstone of accounting practices in France, providing a detailed and structured approach to financial management for businesses. It encapsulates a comprehensive set of principles and standards, including updates and modifications to stay abreast of the evolving financial landscape, thereby ensuring that entities adhere to the highest standards of financial reporting and accountability.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296056, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 307, "prompt_tokens": 630, "total_tokens": 937, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
