It specifically addresses how an entity's decision and its public announcement can create a financial obligation, thereby providing a clear framework for entities to follow when accounting for such liabilities. The advisory aims to ensure that entities have a consistent approach to accounting for liabilities, particularly in situations where the timing or amount of the risk or charge is uncertain.
