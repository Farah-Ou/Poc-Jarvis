The relationship between these two entities is characterized by a consistent reference to the Code de Commerce within the Recueil, indicating a strong reliance on the legal guidelines established by the Code for the formulation and application of accounting standards in France. The Recueil not only includes standards that are directly based on regulations found in the Code de Commerce but also ensures that these standards are applicable and aligned with the broader legal context provided by the Code.
