This term is integral to understanding how tangible assets are categorized and managed within the framework of French accounting, highlighting the importance of these assets in the financial documentation and analysis of a company. The concept of IMMOBILISATIONS CORPORELLES is crucial for detailing the opening and closing balances, increases, and decreases of these assets, providing a comprehensive view of a company's tangible fixed assets over a financial period.\n\nThese assets are considered fixed, meaning they are intended for use over a long period rather than for resale or conversion into cash within a short timeframe. The category includes, but is not limited to, buildings, machinery, and equipment, all of which play a pivotal role in the operational capacity and capital investment of a company. The inclusion of these assets in the French accounting standards under IMMOBILISATIONS CORPORELLES ensures that there is a structured and standardized method for recording, evaluating, and reporting the value and changes in these tangible assets. This structured approach aids in the financial analysis and decision-making processes of businesses, providing clear insights into the physical resources that a company has at its disposal for generating revenue and supporting its operations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296051, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 272, "prompt_tokens": 240, "total_tokens": 512, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
