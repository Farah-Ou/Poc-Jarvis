This regulation meticulously outlines the initial evaluation of tangible and intangible assets as well as inventory, ensuring that the valuation of these assets is consistent and transparent across the board. Furthermore, Article 213-1 addresses the treatment of assets acquired at no cost, stipulating that such assets must be recorded at their fair value at the time of acquisition. This provision ensures that the financial statements of an entity reflect a true and fair view of its asset base, regardless of the manner in which assets are acquired. By mandating the recording of free assets at their fair value, Article 213-1 helps in maintaining the integrity of financial reporting and aids stakeholders in making informed decisions based on the financial statements.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296058, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 171, "prompt_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 350, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
