It plays a pivotal role in the EU's framework by proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding the EU treaties, and overseeing the day-to-day operations of the EU. Among its various responsibilities, the Commission is also tasked with managing specific regulatory aspects, such as those related to environmental concerns.
