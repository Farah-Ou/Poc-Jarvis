This directive encompasses a wide range of assets, including tangible, intangible, inventory, and prepaid expenses, and offers specific guidance on the costs that can be attributed to the cost of acquisition or production of assets. It clarifies the accounting treatment for internally generated intangible assets, borrowing costs, and foreign exchange differences, ensuring that there is a clear understanding of how these elements should be recognized and evaluated in financial statements.\n\nFurthermore, AVIS CNC N° 2004-15 explicitly excludes lease contracts under IAS 17 from its application, indicating a focused approach on asset valuation without the complexities introduced by lease accounting. The directive also addresses the accounting treatment of consortium operations, particularly those related to single-substance dedicated structures, highlighting its comprehensive nature in covering various aspects of asset accounting.\n\nThis advisory note is pivotal in guiding entities on the proper recognition, valuation, and accounting of assets, ensuring consistency and clarity in financial reporting within the French accounting context. It represents a significant event in the realm of French accounting practices, setting a standard for how assets should be handled across different scenarios and industries. The issuance of AVIS CNC N° 2004-15 on June 23, 2004, marks a key moment in the evolution of accounting standards in France, providing a detailed and authoritative source of guidance for accounting professionals and entities alike.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296054, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 331, "prompt_tokens": 1251, "total_tokens": 1582, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

Let's address the missed entities and their relationships based on the provided text and the specified entity types (organization, person, geo, event).Given the nature of the text, which primarily discusses accounting standards and practices without specific references to organizations, persons, or geographical locations in a direct manner, and considering the correction to focus only on the previously extracted entity types, it appears there might have been a misunderstanding in identifying additional entities and relationships from the provided text.The text mainly elaborates on accounting principles related to asset capitalization, cost attribution, and the conditions under which various costs are considered capitalizable or expensed. It references \\\"Avis CNC n° 2004-15,\\\" which has already been identified as an event. The \\\"RECUEIL DES NORMES COMPTABLES FRANÇAISES\\\" has been identified as an organization, which could also be seen as a document or set of standards rather than an organization in a traditional sense.Without specific names, organizations, geographical locations, or events beyond those already identified, and adhering strictly to the instruction to only emit entities that match the previously extracted types, there are no additional entities or relationships directly extractable from the provided text segments.The text does not provide explicit information about persons, additional identifiable organizations, geographical locations, or events beyond what has been identified. It focuses on the technical and financial criteria for asset acquisition and production, cost categorization, and accounting standards without introducing new entities that fit the specified types.Therefore, based on the provided instructions and the content of the text, no further entities or relationships can be accurately added without deviating from the specified entity types or introducing interpretations beyond the explicit content of the text.\", \"A notice from June 23, 2004, regarding the definition, recognition, and valuation of assets in French accounting\", \"A regulatory notice issued on June 23, 2004, concerning the definition, accounting, and valuation of assets including tangible, intangible, inventory, and prepaid expenses\", \"An advisory issued on June 23, 2004, by CNC, related to the definition, recognition, and evaluation of assets, which excludes lease contracts under IAS 17 from its application\", \"An advisory issued on June 23, 2004, regarding the definition, accounting, and valuation of assets\", \"An advisory note from the French Accounting Standards Committee (CNC) regarding the definition, recognition, and valuation of assets, specifically addressing the treatment of foreign exchange differences\", \"An advisory note issued on June 23, 2004, regarding the definition, accounting, and valuation of assets in relation to borrowing costs)<|COMPLETE|>(\\\"entity\\\"\", \"An advisory note related to the definition, accounting, and evaluation of assets issued on June 23, 2004)<|COMPLETE|>I apologize for the oversight. Let's address the missed entities and their relationships based on the provided text about accounting standards and practices in France, focusing on the types: organization, person, geo, and event.Given the nature of the text, it primarily deals with accounting standards and practices, which might not directly mention organizations, persons, geos, or events in the conventional sense. However, interpreting the text with a focus on these entity types, we might consider broader interpretations such as legislative or regulatory bodies as organizations, or specific regulations as events. Unfortunately, without specific names of organizations, people, or locations directly related to the text's content, identifying entities and relationships fitting the requested types is challenging.The text does reference \\\"Avis CNC n° 2004-15\\\" as an advisory note, which I previously identified as an event due to its nature of being a specific issuance of guidelines on a particular date. This interpretation stretches the typical definition of an event to include significant publications or decisions in the context of accounting standards.Given the constraints and the nature of the text, which is highly technical and specific to accounting practices without direct mention of organizations (beyond a general reference to the French accounting standards body), persons, or geographical locations, it's challenging to extract additional entities and relationships without further context or assuming knowledge not directly provided in the text.For a more accurate extraction, specific references to organizations (e.g., the French accounting standards authority), persons (e.g., authors of the standards or significant contributors), or events (e.g., the implementation date of a particular standard) within the text would be required. Without such specifics, any attempt to identify entities and relationships would be speculative and not directly supported by the text provided.\", \"An advisory opinion regarding the accounting treatment of consortium operations, specifically related to single-substance dedicated structures\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_summarize_1a8d92892765c1c7600ba022afb42f7246ba4813778de0af6ba53d67f99f30c5_v2"}
