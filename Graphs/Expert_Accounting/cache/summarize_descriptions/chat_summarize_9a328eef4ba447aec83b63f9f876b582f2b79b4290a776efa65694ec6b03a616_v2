This article explicitly details the types of expenses that must be considered by an entity to fulfill its obligations towards a third party. The primary focus of Article 323-3 is to ensure that companies accurately account for and provision the costs associated with the termination of their operations, including the necessary environmental and infrastructural remediations. By doing so, it aims to provide a clear framework for financial reporting and accountability, ensuring that entities are prepared for the financial implications of their operational wind-down activities.
