These criteria include having a balance sheet total of 25,000,000 euros, net sales amounting to 50,000,000 euros, and maintaining an average workforce of 250 employees. These thresholds are crucial for categorizing a business as a moyenne entreprise within the French economic landscape, ensuring that the classification is consistent across various legal and financial contexts. This definition encapsulates the financial and operational scale that medium-sized businesses in France typically operate within, providing a clear benchmark for regulatory, tax, and financial reporting purposes.
