This entity either comes under the control of the initiating entity or sees its control by the initiating entity strengthened as a result of the operation. In the context of a merger or contribution, the \"ENTITÉ CIBLE\" can be the entity being absorbed or the one receiving contributions. This implies that the \"ENTITÉ CIBLE\" plays a crucial role in the restructuring or consolidation process, serving as the focal point for the transfer of control, assets, or both. The operation signifies a strategic move by the initiating entity to either expand its influence by absorbing the target entity or to bolster the target entity's operations through contributions.
