The CGI, which deals with provisions on asset amortization and fiscal impact, operates within a framework that requires interpretation and application guidelines. These guidelines are issued by the CNC, highlighting the CNC's significant role in shaping how the CGI's provisions are understood and applied in practice. The CNC not only issues these crucial guidelines but also provides opinions that directly influence the interpretation or application of the CGI's rules. This indicates that the CNC has an advisory or interpretative relationship with the CGI, serving as a key authority in clarifying and advising on the CGI's provisions. This relationship ensures that the provisions of the CGI are applied consistently and accurately, guided by the expert interpretations and opinions issued by the CNC.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296159, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 346, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
