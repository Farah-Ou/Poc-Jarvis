This regulation is specifically designed to guide entities in accurately determining the value of their assets, ensuring that the financial statements reflect a true and fair view of the entity's financial position. Article 214-6 defines the concept of fair value, which is essential for the valuation of assets, especially in situations where an active market for those assets does not exist.\n\nThe regulation outlines a comprehensive method for asset valuation, providing entities with a framework to estimate the fair value of their assets based on the best available information. This includes considering future economic benefits that the assets are expected to generate. The importance of Article 214-6 lies in its ability to standardize the approach to asset valuation across entities, promoting consistency and comparability in financial reporting within the French accounting context.\n\nBy defining fair value and specifying how to approach asset valuation in the absence of an active market, Article 214-6 ensures that entities have a clear guideline to follow. This helps in making informed decisions regarding asset management and financial reporting, ultimately contributing to the transparency and reliability of financial information disclosed to stakeholders.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296099, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 242, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 429, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
