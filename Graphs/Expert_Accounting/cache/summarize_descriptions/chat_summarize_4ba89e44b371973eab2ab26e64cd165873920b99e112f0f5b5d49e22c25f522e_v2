This type of pension scheme involves complex calculations that take into account both actuarial and investment risks. In this system, the benefits that retirees receive are determined by specific factors, including their salary history and the number of years they have served. One of the key features of the Régime à Prestations Définies is that the employer bears the investment risk associated with the plan. This means that regardless of the performance of the plan's investments, the employer is responsible for ensuring that the promised benefits are delivered to the retirees. This setup contrasts with defined contribution plans, where the retirement benefits can vary based on investment returns, and the investment risk is typically borne by the employee. The Régime à Prestations Définies thus offers a more predictable retirement income for employees, based on predetermined formulas, but requires careful management and funding by the employer to meet its long-term obligations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296073, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 209, "prompt_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 414, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
