This regulation establishes the accounting framework that social housing organizations must adhere to, detailing specific adaptations and/or derogations from the general accounting plan. Its primary purpose is to ensure that these organizations have a clear set of guidelines to follow, which are somewhat distinct from the broader accounting practices due to the unique nature of social housing. By doing so, Règlement ANC N° 2015-04 aims to standardize financial reporting within this sector, promoting transparency and consistency across organizations that provide social housing services. This regulation is crucial for the proper financial management and oversight of social housing entities, ensuring they operate within a framework that acknowledges their specific operational needs while maintaining rigorous accounting standards.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296133, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 165, "prompt_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 354, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
