These operations encompass the transfer of assets and liabilities under specific contractual terms, highlighting the structured and formal nature of these transactions. Trust operations are not limited to the mere transfer of assets and liabilities; they also include the establishment, functioning, and termination of the trust itself. This indicates a lifecycle approach to trust management, where the initiation of a trust marks the beginning of its operations, followed by its ongoing management and eventual closure or termination. The term \"Opérations de Fiducie\" encapsulates the entirety of this process, from the moment a trust is created, through its active management phase, to its conclusion, ensuring that all activities are conducted in accordance with the agreed-upon terms and conditions.
