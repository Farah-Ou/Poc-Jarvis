This process involves the carryforward of profits or losses into the next fiscal year, allowing for a clear distinction between positive and negative balances. Essentially, it serves as a mechanism to transition the financial outcomes of a company from one year to the next, ensuring that all financial activities are accounted for over time. By subdividing the carryforward amounts, \"REPORT À NOUVEAU\" enables businesses to accurately track their financial health by clearly identifying whether they are moving forward with a surplus (positive balance) or a deficit (negative balance). This practice is crucial for financial planning and analysis, providing a foundational element for assessing a company's performance and making informed decisions for future fiscal strategies.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296116, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 162, "prompt_tokens": 185, "total_tokens": 347, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
