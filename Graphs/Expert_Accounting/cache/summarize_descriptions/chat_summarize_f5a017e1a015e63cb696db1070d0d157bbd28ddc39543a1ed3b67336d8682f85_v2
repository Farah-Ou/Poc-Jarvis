In this arrangement, a property is sold to a buyer before it has been completed. This concept, also known as a sale in the future state of completion, represents a unique approach to buying real estate, where the buyer commits to purchasing a property based on its planned completion and specifications. The VEFA system allows buyers to invest in real estate projects at an early stage, often enabling them to have a say in the final finishes and details of the property. This method of sale is particularly attractive in markets with high demand for new housing, as it provides a mechanism for buyers to secure a new home or investment property before it is physically ready. The VEFA transaction is governed by specific legal frameworks designed to protect both the buyer and the seller during the construction phase and until the property is fully completed and ready for occupancy.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751296092, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 198, "prompt_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 392, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
