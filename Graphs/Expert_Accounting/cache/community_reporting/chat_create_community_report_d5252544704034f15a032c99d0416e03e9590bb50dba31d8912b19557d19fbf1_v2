This term encapsulates the concept of income that has been received by an entity before the corresponding goods or services have been delivered to the purchaser.

Therefore, even though the payment is received in advance, the income is not recognized immediately as revenue but is instead deferred until the delivery of goods or services. This ensures that the financial statements accurately reflect the company's financial position and performance by not overstating revenue or profit in periods prior to the fulfillment of the service or delivery of goods.\",2\r\n1082,DETTE SUR IMMOBILISATIONS ET COMPTES RATTACHÉS,\"\"\"DETTE SUR IMMOBILISATIONS ET COMPTES RATTACHÉS\"\" refers to a specific category within financial accounting that encompasses liabilities associated with fixed assets and their related accounts.
