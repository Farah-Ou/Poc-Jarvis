This patent is amortized over its useful life, which is specifically outlined in various descriptions of its financial treatment. At the time of a merger, Brevet A had a residual utilization period of 5 years, indicating that it was to be fully amortized over this 5-year period. However, there is also mention of a 10-year amortization period intended for Brevet A, suggesting a plan for its near-future sale. This discrepancy can be resolved by considering the 5-year period as the remaining amortization schedule at a specific point in time (the date of the merger), while the 10-year period may refer to the original or a revised amortization schedule based on strategic financial planning or reevaluation of the patent's useful life.\n\nFurthermore, Brevet A was ceded on 30/06/N+2, indicating a transaction or transfer of the patent rights occurred on this date. The mention of a latent tax considered for its latent gain implies that there were tax implications associated with the anticipated gain on the sale of Brevet A, reflecting the careful financial planning and consideration of tax effects on the patent's disposal.\n\nIn summary, Brevet A is a patent treated as an amortizable and depreciable asset in accounting, with a noted residual utilization period of 5 years at the merger's date, initially or subsequently adjusted to a 10-year amortization period for strategic reasons. The patent was part of a transaction on 30/06/N+2, with its latent gain subject to tax considerations, highlighting the financial and strategic planning involved in managing this intellectual property asset.\",4\r\n1041,ARTICLE 745-7,,2\r\n1036,BREVET B,\"Brevet B is an intangible asset recognized in financial accounting for its specific treatment regarding amortization and depreciation. Initially, this patent was set to be amortized over a 15-year period, reflecting its expected useful life. However, at the time of a merger, it had a residual utilization period of 5 years, leading to an adjustment in its amortization schedule to be spread over these remaining 5 years. This adjustment aligns with the financial practices of handling such intellectual property assets, ensuring that their value is accurately represented in financial statements over time.\n\nBrevet B is notable for its lack of immediate intention for sale, which is an important consideration in its financial treatment. This decision against a near-future sale means that no latent tax effects are accounted for in its financial handling. The consistent approach to its amortization—initially over a 15-year period and later adjusted to the remaining 5 years at the date of a merger—underscores the methodical financial management of this patent. As an intellectual property asset, Brevet B's specific amortization schedule and the decision not to consider latent tax effects reflect a strategic approach to its financial accounting processes. This comprehensive understanding of Brevet B highlights its role as a valuable, though complex, asset within the financial accounting framework, managed with a clear strategy regarding its amortization and overall financial treatment.\",4\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1103,BREVET A,TERRAIN,Both Patent A and Land are intended for near-future sale with latent tax effects considered,7\r\n1116,BREVET A,ARTICLE 745-7,The amortization of Brevet A is conducted in accordance with Article 745-7,6\r\n1117,BREVET B,ARTICLE 745-7,The amortization of Brevet B is conducted in accordance with Article 745-7,6\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
