This innovative scheme operates by granting real estate rights to tenants, which encompasses the ability to maintain, repair, and, under specific conditions, sell or transfer these rights. A key feature of the BRS is its approach to separating the value of land from the value of construction. This separation significantly reduces the overall cost of property ownership, making it a more attainable goal for individuals and families.\n\nAdministered by social housing organizations, the BRS aims to provide a sustainable solution to the housing affordability crisis. By offering real estate rights rather than traditional property ownership, the BRS ensures that homes remain affordable for future generations. This is achieved through a controlled resale mechanism, which allows the original tenant to sell their rights, but within the framework established by the BRS agreement, ensuring that the property remains part of the affordable housing stock.\n\nIn essence, the Bail Réel Solidaire is not just a lease agreement but a comprehensive system designed to democratize access to property ownership. It addresses the financial barriers that many face when attempting to purchase a home, without compromising on the rights and responsibilities that come with property maintenance and stewardship. Through its innovative structure, the BRS represents a significant step forward in making home ownership a reality for a broader segment of the population, supported by the guiding hand of social housing organizations.\",10\r\n1613,ARTICLE L. 443-7 DU CODE DE LA CONSTRUCTION ET DE L'HABITATION,,1\r\n1608,ARTICLE L. 255-4 DU CODE DE LA CONSTRUCTION ET DE L'HABITATION,\"Article related to housing law, not specifically targeting BRS agreements for rental housing\",1\r\n1610,ARTICLE 182-2,Article stating that a BRS operation granting real estate rights for property ownership is considered a sale of the property,1\r\n1611,ARTICLE 181-1,\"Article mentioned in the context of BRS operations, likely detailing provisions for real estate rights granted to the lessee for property ownership\",1\r\n1607,ORGANISME DE LOGEMENT SOCIAL AGRÉÉ OFS,\"Social housing organizations approved by OFS, involved in construction, acquisition, and rehabilitation of housing on land owned by another approved entity\",3\r\n1609,ARTICLE 182-1,\"Article detailing the accounting rules for land used in a BRS operation, specifying it as a specific sub-account of tangible assets\",1\r\n1612,ARTICLES 214-15 AND 214-16 DU RÈGLEMENT ANC N° 2014-03,Articles specifying the conditions under which a depreciation test must be conducted for land in a BRS operation,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1504,BAIL RÉEL SOLIDAIRE (BRS),CODE DE LA CONSTRUCTION ET DE L'HABITATION,\"The Bail Réel Solidaire (BRS) is a legal mechanism that is defined and regulated under the Code de la Construction et de l'Habitation.
