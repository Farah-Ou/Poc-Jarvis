Primarily, it refers to the equity of a company, which is a critical component in the issuance of capital equity instruments and the associated costs. This equity section within the accounting framework includes issued capital, premiums, and reserves, highlighting the multifaceted nature of capital in corporate finance.\n\nMoreover, \"\"CAPITAL\"\" extends beyond just the equity on paper; it also represents the financial assets or the financial value of assets that a company owns. This includes tangible assets such as cash and buildings, underscoring the broader definition of capital as the economic resource that a company utilizes for its operations and growth. It is not limited to the equity value represented in financial statements but also encompasses the real-world assets that contribute to the company's market value and operational capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, \"\"CAPITAL\"\" is used to denote the specific account within a company's financial records where the equity capital is recorded. This account is crucial for both internal management and external reporting, as it provides a clear view of the company's equity structure. It includes the initial and any additional capital introduced, as well as the accumulated reserves and premiums over the company's life. This comprehensive approach to understanding \"\"CAPITAL\"\" within the French accounting standards offers a holistic view of a company's financial health, asset management, and equity structure, reflecting the complex interplay between various forms of capital in corporate finance.\",23\r\n293,PRIME D'EMISSION,\"The premium over the nominal value at which shares are issued, reflecting additional capital paid in by shareholders\",2\r\n1106,CRÉANCES CLIENTS ET COMPTES RATTACHÉS,\"Accounts receivable and related accounts, representing money owed by customers\",1\r\n1108,AUTRES CRÉANCES,\"Other receivables, representing various other amounts owed to the company\",1\r\n1109,EMPRUNTS ET DETTES ASSIMILÉES,\"Loans and similar debts, representing borrowed funds that need to be repaid\",1\r\n1081,AVANCES ET ACOMPTES REÇUS SUR COMMANDES EN COURS,Advances and payments received for orders that are still in progress,1\r\n1134,ACTIONS ET PARTS SOCIALES ÉMISES PENDANT L’EXERCICE,,1\r\n1133,TABLEAU DE VARIATION DES CAPITAUX PROPRES,\"A table showing the changes in equity capital over the fiscal year, including allocations of previous year's results, dividend distributions, capital increases and decreases, and the result of the fiscal year\",1\r\n1359,TITRES ÉVALUÉS PAR ÉQUIVALENCE,Securities of companies controlled exclusively and evaluated by the equity method,1\r\n1425,ACTIONNAIRES DÉFAILLANTS,Shareholders who have not fulfilled their obligations during a capital call,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1167,RECUEIL DES NORMES COMPTABLES FRANÇAISES,PROVISIONS,Provisions for risks and charges are outlined in French accounting standards,547\r\n1182,CAPITAL,STOCKS ET EN-COURS,Inventory and work in progress are part of a company's overall capital,26\r\n257,PRIME D'EMISSION,CAPITAL,Capital and Prime d'Emission are directly related in the context of share issuance and the financial structuring of equity,25\r\n1183,CAPITAL,CRÉANCES CLIENTS ET COMPTES RATTACHÉS,Accounts receivable and related accounts are part of a company's overall capital,24\r\n1185,CAPITAL,AUTRES CRÉANCES,Other receivables are part of a company's overall capital,24\r\n1186,CAPITAL,EMPRUNTS ET DETTES ASSIMILÉES,Loans and similar debts are part of a company's overall capital,24\r\n1191,CAPITAL,AVANCES ET ACOMPTES REÇUS SUR COMMANDES EN COURS,Advances and payments received on ongoing orders are financial transactions affecting a company's capital,24\r\n1199,CAPITAL,ACTIONS ET PARTS SOCIALES ÉMISES PENDANT L’EXERCICE,\"The issuance of shares and social parts directly affects the capital structure of a company, as detailed in the event of capital changes\",24\r\n1200,CAPITAL,TABLEAU DE VARIATION DES CAPITAUX PROPRES,\"The table of changes in equity capital provides a detailed account of how the capital has evolved over the fiscal year, including the impact of the event of capital changes\",24\r\n1325,CAPITAL,TITRES ÉVALUÉS PAR ÉQUIVALENCE,\"Securities evaluated by the equity method are related to the capital of the company, reflecting its investment value\",24\r\n1369,CAPITAL,ACTIONNAIRES DÉFAILLANTS,Shareholders who fail to meet their obligations impact the capital call process,24\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
