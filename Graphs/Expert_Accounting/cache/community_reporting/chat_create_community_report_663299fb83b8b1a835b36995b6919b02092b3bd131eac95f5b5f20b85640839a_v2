This requirement not only ensures that companies are accountable for their emissions but also drives the demand for emission quotas in the market. The need to comply with these regulations influences companies to engage in future purchase agreements ('ACHATS À TERME') and to track their emission quotas through 'COMPTABILITÉ MATIÈRE'. The regulatory framework thus sets the stage for all subsequent transactions and accounting practices within this network.

By entering into future purchase agreements for emission quotas, companies can hedge against the risk of quota price fluctuations and ensure they have sufficient quotas to cover their emissions. This proactive approach not only aids in regulatory compliance but also in financial planning, as it provides cost certainty for emission management.

This accounting practice ensures transparency and accountability in how companies manage their emission quotas.

The direct relationship between 'DÉFICIT DE QUOTAS' and 'ACHATS STOCKÉS – MATIÈRES PREMIÈRES' indicates that managing a deficit often involves purchasing raw materials and supplies, including emission quotas, to comply with regulatory requirements.
