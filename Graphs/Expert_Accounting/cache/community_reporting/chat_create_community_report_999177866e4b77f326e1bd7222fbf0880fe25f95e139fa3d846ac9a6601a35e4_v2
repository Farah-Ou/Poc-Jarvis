These distributors play a crucial role in the financial ecosystem of electrical and electronic equipment sales. They are responsible for accounting for the financial contribution paid to producers as part of the acquisition cost of such equipment. This financial contribution is aimed at covering the expenses related to the disposal and recycling of waste equipment, ensuring an environmentally responsible end-of-life for these products.\n\nFurthermore, DISTRIBUTEURs incorporate this financial contribution into the sales price charged to the final customer, effectively acting as intermediaries who manage the flow of funds dedicated to waste equipment management. They operate in their own name and on their own account, engaging directly with both producers and the final customer. This engagement involves handling the financial aspects related to the environmental responsibilities of disposing of electrical and electronic equipment. By doing so, DISTRIBUTEURs ensure that the costs associated with the environmentally safe disposal and recycling of these products are transparently integrated into the economic transactions between producers, distributors, and end users. This system not only facilitates the responsible management of electronic waste but also embeds the principles of environmental stewardship into the commercial distribution of electrical and electronic products.\",5\r\n883,PRODUCTEUR,\"PRODUCTEUR refers to any individual or entity engaged in the professional activity of manufacturing, importing, or introducing electrical and electronic equipment into the national market. These producers play a crucial role in the lifecycle of electrical and electronic goods, not only by bringing these products to market but also by bearing financial responsibilities related to the environmental impact of these items. As part of their obligations, PRODUCTEURs are required to account for a financial contribution within the sales price of the electrical and electronic equipment they deal with. This contribution is not merely an additional cost but is intended to cover the expenses associated with the collection, removal, and treatment of waste generated from electrical and electronic equipment once it reaches the end of its life.\n\nTo ensure the proper management of this environmental responsibility, PRODUCTEURs are mandated to pay the financial contribution to an approved organization. This organization is tasked with overseeing the proper disposal and recycling processes, ensuring that the waste from electrical and electronic equipment is treated in an environmentally friendly manner. By doing so, PRODUCTEURs contribute to the broader efforts of reducing the environmental footprint of electronic waste, aligning with global initiatives to promote sustainability and responsible waste management in the electronics industry. This comprehensive approach underscores the critical role PRODUCTEURs play in not only providing technological solutions to the market but also in safeguarding the environment by mitigating the adverse effects of electronic waste.\",6\r\n882,DÉCRET N° 2005-829,\"A decree related to the composition of electrical and electronic equipment and the elimination of waste from these equipments, established on 20 July 2005\",2\r\n885,ORGANISME AGRÉÉ,,1\r\n895,IAS 18,,1\r\n896,CLIENT FINAL,,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n921,DISTRIBUTEUR,CODE DE L'ENVIRONNEMENT,\"Distributors must show the costs for waste disposal of electrical and electronic equipment on invoices, as per the environmental code\",20\r\n909,PRODUCTEUR,DISTRIBUTEUR,\"PRODUCTEUR (Producers) and DISTRIBUTEUR (Distributors) are integral parts of the supply chain, especially in the context of managing waste from electrical and electronic equipment, as mandated by a specific decree. Their interactions are primarily financial and regulatory, focusing on the environmental responsibilities tied to the products they manufacture, distribute, and sell.\n\nProducers are responsible for creating electrical and electronic equipment, and they engage with distributors during transactions, particularly concerning the financial contributions for the disposal and recycling of waste equipment. This financial contribution is a critical aspect of their relationship, as it is part of the acquisition cost that distributors pay to producers. This arrangement indicates that producers charge a fee to cover the expenses related to the environmental management of the products at the end of their life cycle.\n\nDistributors, on the other hand, play a dual role. Firstly, they act on their own behalf when dealing with producers over the financial contribution for waste equipment management. This means they negotiate or agree on the amount that needs to be paid as part of their acquisition of the products. Secondly, distributors integrate this financial contribution into the selling price of the equipment. This practice suggests that the cost associated with the environmental management of the products is passed on to the end consumers, making them indirectly part of the recycling and disposal process.\n\nBoth producers and distributors are thus deeply involved in the environmental aspect of the products' life cycle. Their collaboration and financial transactions ensure compliance with regulations aimed at managing waste from electrical and electronic equipment efficiently. This system not only facilitates the responsible disposal and recycling of electronic waste but also embeds the cost of these environmental responsibilities into the product's lifecycle, from production to sale, and eventually, to disposal.\",11\r\n907,DÉCRET N° 2005-829,PRODUCTEUR,The decree outlines obligations for producers regarding the disposal and treatment of electrical and electronic equipment waste,8\r\n910,PRODUCTEUR,ORGANISME AGRÉÉ,\"PRODUCTEUR (Producers) and ORGANISME AGRÉÉ (Approved Organization) are entities involved in a regulatory framework concerning waste management services. According to the decree, producers have the option to fulfill their obligations regarding waste management by joining an approved organization. This arrangement involves producers paying a financial contribution to an authorized (or approved) organization, which then undertakes the responsibility for waste management services on their behalf. This financial contribution is considered an operating expense for the producers. The relationship between PRODUCTEUR and ORGANISME AGRÉÉ is thus characterized by a financial transaction where the producers fund the waste management services provided by the approved organization, ensuring compliance with regulatory obligations. This system allows producers to effectively manage their waste management responsibilities by outsourcing these services to specialized, approved organizations.\",7\r\n924,PRODUCTEUR,IAS 18,\"The financial contribution by producers, as part of their cost, is considered in the context of IAS 18's guidelines on revenue and cost recognition\",7\r\n927,DISTRIBUTEUR,CLIENT FINAL,Distributors charge the final customer the financial contribution as part of the sales price,6\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
