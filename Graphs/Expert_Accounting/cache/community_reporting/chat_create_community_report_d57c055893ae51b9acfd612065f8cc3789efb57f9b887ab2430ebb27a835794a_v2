This type of pension scheme involves complex calculations that take into account both actuarial and investment risks. In this system, the benefits that retirees receive are determined by specific factors, including their salary history and the number of years they have served. One of the key features of the Régime à Prestations Définies is that the employer bears the investment risk associated with the plan. This means that regardless of the performance of the plan's investments, the employer is responsible for ensuring that the promised benefits are delivered to the retirees. This setup contrasts with defined contribution plans, where the retirement benefits can vary based on investment returns, and the investment risk is typically borne by the employee. The Régime à Prestations Définies thus offers a more predictable retirement income for employees, based on predetermined formulas, but requires careful management and funding by the employer to meet its long-term obligations.\",5\r\n368,RÉGIME À COTISATIONS DÉFINIES,,4\r\n373,ENTREPRISE,,4\r\n366,RÉGIME INTER-ENTREPRISES,A type of pension scheme that can be classified as either a defined contribution or a defined benefit plan based on its terms and any implicit obligations,3\r\n369,RÉGIME INTERENTREPRISES,\"A scheme involving multiple employers pooling assets for investment purposes to reduce administration and management costs, without sharing actuarial risks related to active and former employees of other companies\",3\r\n800,MATIÈRES PREMIÈRES,\"The raw materials involved in a future contract by a company to secure a price for 100 tonnes, eventually purchased at 260 Euros/ton from a supplier\",3\r\n376,MEMBRE DU PERSONNEL,\"Staff members who are part of a defined benefit plan, generating obligations through their service years\",1\r\n799,CONTRAT FUTURE,\"A financial instrument used by a company to hedge against the risk of price changes in raw materials, with a transaction involving 100 tonnes of raw materials at a maturity of 6 months and a price of 200 Euros/ton\",3\r\n801,FOURNISSEUR,The supplier from whom the enterprise eventually buys 100 tonnes of raw materials at a price of 260 euros/ton,2\r\n370,RÉGIME D'ADMINISTRATION GROUPÉE,\"A collective administration scheme that allows employers to pool assets for investment purposes, similar to a multi-employer scheme but without sharing actuarial risks\",1\r\n371,PASSIF ÉVENTUEL,,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n327,RÉGIME À PRESTATIONS DÉFINIES,RÉGIME À COTISATIONS DÉFINIES,\"Defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans are two different approaches to post-employment benefits, with the former having direct financial obligations and the latter involving complex actuarial evaluations and potential investment risks\",9\r\n329,RÉGIME À PRESTATIONS DÉFINIES,ENTREPRISE,\"The entreprise is responsible for the actuarial and investment risks of the régime à prestations définies, indicating a direct responsibility for managing and funding the plan\",9\r\n321,RÉGIME INTER-ENTREPRISES,RÉGIME À PRESTATIONS DÉFINIES,The Régime à Prestations Définies is a type of Régime Inter-Entreprises that provides defined benefits to its members,8\r\n323,RÉGIME INTERENTREPRISES,RÉGIME À COTISATIONS DÉFINIES,The inter-company scheme is distinguished from group administration schemes and can be classified as a defined contribution or defined benefit plan based on its terms,7\r\n804,MATIÈRES PREMIÈRES,ENTREPRISE,The enterprise's future contract and eventual purchase are centered around raw materials,7\r\n332,MEMBRE DU PERSONNEL,RÉGIME À PRESTATIONS DÉFINIES,The defined benefit plan creates obligations for staff members based on their service years and conditions for benefit acquisition,6\r\n802,CONTRAT FUTURE,MATIÈRES PREMIÈRES,The future contract was specifically for the purchase of raw materials to hedge against price risk,6\r\n806,FOURNISSEUR,ENTREPRISE,The enterprise buys 100 tonnes of raw materials from the supplier at a settled price,6\r\n326,RÉGIME À COTISATIONS DÉFINIES,RÉGIME D'ADMINISTRATION GROUPÉE,\"Group administration schemes do not pose special accounting problems and can be treated like any other single-employer plan, implying a close relationship to defined contribution plans\",5\r\n325,RÉGIME INTERENTREPRISES,PASSIF ÉVENTUEL,An inter-company scheme may result in a potential liability due to shared actuarial risks or the obligation to cover a scheme deficit if other companies withdraw,4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
