This entity holds the right of preemption, allowing it to be the first in line to buy real estate before it can be offered to another buyer. This right is crucial in ensuring that OFS can maintain or expand its portfolio of social housing properties to meet its mission objectives.\n\nUpon the termination or cancellation of a lease, OFS not only becomes the owner of the real estate improvements made during the lease period but also recovers full ownership of the properties under BRS operations. This process involves compensating lessees for the real estate rights attached to the housing and any improvements they have made during the lease. This compensation is a critical aspect of OFS's operations, as it ensures that lessees are fairly reimbursed for their investments in the property, thus maintaining a balance between the interests of the organization and those of the residents.\n\nMoreover, OFS's role in the social housing sector is highlighted by its ability to lose and subsequently recover property attributes of housing under BRS operations. This dynamic capability demonstrates OFS's flexibility and commitment to providing affordable housing options. By recovering real estate rights at the end of the lease, OFS ensures that properties can continue to serve the social housing mission, thereby contributing to the stability and growth of communities.\n\nIn summary, OFS stands out as a pivotal entity in the social housing sector, with its operations centered around the acquisition, improvement, and management of real estate for social purposes. Its unique model of engaging in real estate transactions, compensating lessees, and managing property rights underlines its commitment to affordable housing and community development.\",7\r\n64,ORGANISMES DE LOGEMENT SOCIAL,\"Organismes de Logement Social (OLS) are specialized organizations dedicated to providing social housing solutions. These entities operate under a unique framework that subjects them to specific accounting rules and operational practices, which significantly influence their financial statements. Their primary mission is to offer affordable housing options to individuals and families in need, ensuring that everyone has access to safe and secure living conditions.\n\nIn addition to their general role in social housing, these organizations are approved to function as Organismes de Foncier Solidaire (OFS). As OFS, they are authorized to provide housing through a real solidarity lease (Bail Réel Solidaire or BRS) scheme. This innovative leasing model is designed to promote housing affordability and accessibility, further emphasizing the social mission of these entities. The BRS scheme allows households to benefit from secure, long-term housing at reduced costs, thereby supporting social inclusion and community stability.\n\nOverall, Organismes de Logement Social play a crucial role in the social housing sector, guided by a commitment to solidarity and the well-being of underprivileged populations. Through their operations as OFS and the implementation of the BRS scheme, they contribute significantly to addressing housing challenges and fostering inclusive communities.\",8\r\n65,ORGANISMES DE FONCIER SOLIDAIRE,\"Organismes de Foncier Solidaire (OFS) are organizations dedicated to fostering land solidarity through innovative operations, primarily focusing on supporting social housing initiatives. These entities play a crucial role in the real estate sector by engaging in activities that include leasing land or real estate with the aim of creating affordable housing options for those in need. Their operations are not limited to residential projects; they also extend to developing community facilities that serve the wider public interest.\n\nThe core mission of OFS is to own and manage land or real estate in a manner that aligns with construction and housing codes, ensuring that all projects adhere to the highest standards of safety, sustainability, and accessibility. By doing so, they contribute significantly to the alleviation of housing crises in various regions, making it possible for lower-income families to access quality housing at reduced costs. The approach taken by these organizations is grounded in the principles of solidarity and equity, aiming to counteract the effects of market volatility and the increasing scarcity of affordable housing options.\n\nIn essence, Organismes de Foncier Solidaire are pivotal in promoting social cohesion through the development of affordable housing and community facilities. Their work involves a strategic blend of real estate management and social advocacy, positioning them as key players in the effort to ensure that everyone, regardless of their economic status, has access to safe, affordable, and dignified living conditions. Through their dedicated efforts, OFS are making significant strides towards creating more inclusive communities where the right to housing is realized for all.\",2\r\n1614,BRS,\"BRS, or Bail Réel Solidaire, is a housing scheme designed to facilitate property ownership under specific conditions. This innovative real estate operation involves social housing organizations and aims to make home ownership more accessible to a broader range of individuals. Under the BRS framework, real estate rights are granted to the lessee, allowing them to own property while adhering to predetermined conditions related to the maintenance of the property, the payment of taxes, and the eventual transfer or loss of rights associated with the property.\n\nThe BRS model is particularly noteworthy for its role in providing for the acquisition of real estate rights while also compensating lessees. This compensation mechanism is a critical component of the BRS scheme, as it ensures that lessees are supported throughout their ownership journey, making it a more equitable and sustainable approach to property ownership. By involving social housing organizations, BRS also emphasizes the importance of community and social responsibility in the real estate sector, aiming to create more inclusive housing opportunities for individuals who might otherwise be excluded from the traditional housing market.\n\nOverall, BRS represents a significant shift in how property ownership is conceptualized and implemented, offering a more socially responsible and accessible path to owning a home. Through its unique combination of granting real estate rights, requiring adherence to specific maintenance and tax conditions, and providing compensation to lessees, BRS seeks to balance the benefits of property ownership with broader social and community objectives.\",2\r\n1605,CODE DE L'URBANISME,,2\r\n1597,ORGANISMES DE LOGEMENT SOCIAL AGRÉÉS,,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1505,OFS,ORGANISMES DE LOGEMENT SOCIAL,OFS can approve social housing organizations to operate under the BRS scheme,15\r\n42,ORGANISMES DE LOGEMENT SOCIAL,ORGANISMES DE FONCIER SOLIDAIRE,Social housing organizations may engage in operations through land solidarity organizations,10\r\n1523,BRS,PRENEUR,\"The preneur engages in BRS operations, obtaining real estate rights to a property with obligations for its upkeep and the possibility of transferring these rights\",6\r\n1503,ORGANISMES DE FONCIER SOLIDAIRE (OFS),CODE DE L'URBANISME,\"OFS are regulated and approved according to the Code de l'Urbanisme, showing a legal and operational relationship\",5\r\n1493,ORGANISMES DE FONCIER SOLIDAIRE,ORGANISMES DE LOGEMENT SOCIAL AGRÉÉS,Organismes de logement social agréés may operate as or in conjunction with organismes de foncier solidaire to provide affordable housing,3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
