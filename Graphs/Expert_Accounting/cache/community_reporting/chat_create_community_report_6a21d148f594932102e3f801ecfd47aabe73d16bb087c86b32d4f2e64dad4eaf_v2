This regulation is a key piece of legislation within the French accounting standards framework, designed to guide the preparation and presentation of consolidated financial statements. One notable aspect of Règlement ANC N° 2020-01 is its lack of a specific definition for exceptional results. This omission necessitates that individuals and entities looking to understand or apply the regulation in this context must refer to the broader French accounting standards for interpretation and guidance.\n\nFurthermore, Règlement ANC N° 2020-01 addresses the treatment of both internal and external costs that are related to acquisitions and the issuance of titles. This inclusion highlights the regulation's comprehensive approach to ensuring that the financial statements of groups of companies reflect a true and fair view of their financial position and performance, particularly in the context of complex financial transactions such as acquisitions and emissions of titles.\n\nOverall, Règlement ANC N° 2020-01 serves as a critical component of the regulatory framework governing consolidated accounts in France, emphasizing the importance of clarity, accuracy, and consistency in financial reporting. Its provisions, while lacking in certain specific definitions, are part of a broader set of accounting standards that collectively ensure the reliability and comparability of financial information across entities.\",9\r\n243,ARTICLE 232-9,A regulation from the ANC n° 2020-01 regarding the treatment of certain costs in consolidated equity,1\r\n966,ARTICLE 211-3,\"Article 211-3 defines exclusive control in the context of consolidated accounts according to ANC regulation No. 2020-01.

The definition provided by Article 211-3 is crucial for entities to understand their reporting obligations and the scope of their financial statements. By establishing clear guidelines on what constitutes exclusive control, this article helps ensure that entities accurately reflect their financial positions and relationships with other entities in their consolidated accounts, in line with the requirements set forth by ANC regulation No. 2020-01.\",1\r\n967,ARTICLE 211-4,Defines joint control in the context of consolidated accounts,1\r\n1010,ENTITÉ ABSORBÉE,\"The \"\"ENTITÉ ABSORBÉE\"\" refers to the entity whose shares are acquired by another entity, leading to its absorption into that entity.

This means that after the merger or acquisition is completed, the ENTITÉ ABSORBÉE ceases to exist as an independent entity and becomes part of the larger, absorbing entity. The integration involves a comprehensive transfer of all operational, financial, and legal aspects of the ENTITÉ ABSORBÉE to the entity that has taken it over.

This accounting practice is integral to the financial management of mergers and acquisitions, ensuring that the premium paid over the net asset value of the acquired entity is systematically recorded. The recognition of PRIME DE FUSION in a sub-account facilitates a clearer financial analysis and valuation of the merger or acquisition process, highlighting the additional value that the acquiring company perceives in the transaction beyond the tangible assets and liabilities.
