These certificates are essentially financial instruments that entities can obtain as compensation for undertaking direct energy-saving measures. The system obligates certain entities to achieve specific energy savings, offering them the flexibility to meet these obligations either by implementing direct energy-saving actions or by engaging in transactions on the energy savings certificates market.\n\nThe CEE mechanism serves a dual purpose: it incentivizes energy efficiency and creates a market for trading energy savings. Entities that exceed their energy-saving targets can sell their excess certificates to those that are unable to meet their obligations, fostering a market-driven approach to energy conservation. This system not only encourages entities to reduce their energy consumption but also facilitates the trading of Energy Savings Certificates, thereby enabling a financial valuation of energy-saving efforts.\n\nIn summary, the Certificats d'Économies d'Énergie program is a comprehensive approach in France that combines regulatory obligations with market mechanisms to drive energy efficiency across various sectors. By allowing entities to either directly reduce energy consumption or participate in a trading system, the CEE ensures that energy-saving goals are met in a flexible and economically efficient manner.\",14\r\n113,FONDS COMMERCIAL,\"FONDS COMMERCIAL is a legal concept in French accounting law that embodies the essence of a business, including its clientele, market share, and potentially associated assets such as patents, trademarks, and leases. It is recognized as a commercial fund with a book value of 2,700 at the beginning of the year, which is not depreciated, and it has a net goodwill of 800 by the end of the year. This goodwill, which represents the value of acquired business elements that cannot be classified under other balance sheet items, is not accounted for in the absorbing entity's accounts. It is valued at 3,500 but is only recognized up to the allocated technical deficit of 2,700.\n\nGoodwill is a crucial component of FONDS COMMERCIAL, indicating the excess value of a business above its tangible assets and liabilities. It reflects the depreciation in value in the accounting records, showcasing a decrease in the intangible assets' worth over time. Despite this depreciation, goodwill is essential for representing the acquisition of intangible assets of a business that are not separately evaluated and accounted for on the balance sheet. These assets contribute significantly to the maintenance or development of the entity's activity potential.\n\nFurthermore, FONDS COMMERCIAL plays a vital role in the merger process by representing the intangible assets, specifically business goodwill, involved. This aspect underscores the importance of goodwill in enhancing a company's value beyond its physical assets and liabilities, thereby contributing to its overall market position and potential for growth. Through FONDS COMMERCIAL, businesses can quantify and leverage their intangible assets, such as customer relationships and brand reputation, which are critical for sustaining competitive advantage and fostering long-term success.\",7\r\n1027,PERSONNE MORALE M,Personne Morale M is a corporate entity that controls Entité A and loses or retains control based on different corporate operations,3\r\n131,ENTITÉ A,\"Entité A is a dynamic organization that has recently undergone significant financial and structural changes.

This financial turnaround is part of a broader strategy involving complex corporate operations, including mergers, acquisitions, and asset contributions.\n\nEntité A played a central role in absorbing Entité B, a move that involved evaluating contributions at book value and addressing technical goodwill. This absorption was part of a larger merger and acquisition process, indicating Entité A's strategic approach to growth and expansion. The organization not only absorbed Entité B but also planned to sell certain assets in the near future, showcasing a proactive and strategic approach to asset management and corporate restructuring.\n\nThe merger and acquisition activities extended beyond Entité B, as Entité A also received title contributions from Entités B, D, and E, which resulted in gaining control over Entité C. This expansion through title contributions and asset acquisitions demonstrates Entité A's aggressive strategy in consolidating its market position and diversifying its holdings. Furthermore, Entité A was involved in a scission operation with Entité C, receiving a portion of assets without an exchange of titles, further illustrating its complex involvement in corporate restructuring and asset reallocation.\n\nEntité A has been a target in various operations involving control and asset valuation, indicating its significant role and value in the market. Its involvement in diverse operations of merger, contribution, and ownership changes highlights its strategic maneuvers to strengthen its position and control within the industry.\n\nIn summary, Entité A is an organization that has effectively navigated through financial recovery, strategic mergers, and acquisitions, as well as asset contributions and restructurings. Its ability to absorb other entities, manage technical goodwill, and strategically sell assets or gain control over others like Entité C, positions it as a key player in its field, actively engaging in operations that signify changes in control and property ownership.

It was absorbed by Entité A on January 1st, N, a process during which Entité B's contributions were evaluated at book value. This merger was notable for the fact that Entité A already held 60% of Entité B's titles prior to the absorption, indicating a pre-existing control over Entité B. The merger did not involve an exchange of titles with Entité C, from which Entité B received all assets and liabilities, suggesting a complex web of corporate restructuring and control shifts within this group of entities.\n\nEntité B's involvement in these operations was multifaceted, including the contribution of titles to Entité A, which underscores its role as both a participant in and a subject of these corporate maneuvers. This entity was not only a key player in the mergers and contributions with Entité A but also participated in changes of control, highlighting its strategic importance in the overarching corporate structure controlled by Entité M.\n\nThe description of Entité B as an initiator in operations involving control and asset valuation, and as becoming the controlling entity in certain scenarios, further illustrates its dynamic role within this network of entities.

It encompasses the technical goodwill or negative goodwill that emerges from corporate mergers or acquisitions. This concept is crucial for understanding how latent gains or liabilities, which are not recorded in the absorbed entity's accounts, are calculated, allocated, and subsequently amortized. The Mali Technique is specifically tied to the treatment of technical goodwill, which involves a detailed process outlined within the \"\"RECUEIL DES NORMES COMPTABLES FRANÇAISES,\"\" a compendium of French accounting standards.\n\nThis accounting treatment is significant for its role in the amortization of technical goodwill, highlighting the intricate methodologies employed in the French accounting system to address the financial implications of corporate restructuring events. The Mali Technique's application ensures that financial statements accurately reflect the economic realities of mergers or acquisitions by identifying and quantifying goodwill or negative goodwill that may not be immediately apparent in the financial records of the entities involved.\n\nGiven its technical nature, the Mali Technique is an essential aspect of accounting practices that deal with the complexities arising from mergers or the universal transmission of assets. It serves as a critical tool for accountants and financial analysts in France, enabling them to adhere to national standards while ensuring that corporate financial disclosures provide a transparent and comprehensive view of an entity's financial health post-merger or acquisition. This technique underscores the importance of meticulous financial analysis and reporting in capturing the full scope of corporate transactions, particularly those involving significant structural changes.\",2\r\n1021,\"ENTITÉS A, B, D\",,1\r\n1026,PP2,A physical person controlling Entité B,1\r\n1036,BREVET B,\"Brevet B is an intangible asset recognized in financial accounting for its specific treatment regarding amortization and depreciation. Initially, this patent was set to be amortized over a 15-year period, reflecting its expected useful life. However, at the time of a merger, it had a residual utilization period of 5 years, leading to an adjustment in its amortization schedule to be spread over these remaining 5 years. This adjustment aligns with the financial practices of handling such intellectual property assets, ensuring that their value is accurately represented in financial statements over time.\n\nBrevet B is notable for its lack of immediate intention for sale, which is an important consideration in its financial treatment. This decision against a near-future sale means that no latent tax effects are accounted for in its financial handling. The consistent approach to its amortization—initially over a 15-year period and later adjusted to the remaining 5 years at the date of a merger—underscores the methodical financial management of this patent. As an intellectual property asset, Brevet B's specific amortization schedule and the decision not to consider latent tax effects reflect a strategic approach to its financial accounting processes. This comprehensive understanding of Brevet B highlights its role as a valuable, though complex, asset within the financial accounting framework, managed with a clear strategy regarding its amortization and overall financial treatment.\",4\r\n1040,IMPÔTS SUR DÉFICITS REPORTABLES,\"The \"\"Impôts sur Déficits Reportables\"\" refers to the tax implications associated with recoverable deficits, specifically in the context of an entity that has been absorbed. This tax allocation takes into account the latent tax on short-term planned asset disposals. It is designed to address the financial treatment of carryforward losses, which are losses that a company can use to offset future profit to reduce its tax liability. As of January 1 of year N (denoted as 1/1/N), these carryforward losses were valued at 1,000 units of currency. Over the course of the year, 450 of these units were amortized. This means that a portion of the recoverable deficits was utilized or accounted for within the year's financial activities, reducing the total amount of losses that can be carried forward to offset taxable income in future periods. The mechanism serves as a critical financial tool for companies, allowing them to manage their tax liabilities more effectively by leveraging losses incurred in previous periods.\",2\r\n1341,DROIT AU BAIL,Amount paid or due to the previous tenant for the transfer of rights from agreements and commercial property legislation,1\r\n1035,BREVET A,\"Brevet A is a patent recognized as an intellectual property asset within the accounting records, subject to both amortization and depreciation calculations. This patent is amortized over its useful life, which is specifically outlined in various descriptions of its financial treatment. At the time of a merger, Brevet A had a residual utilization period of 5 years, indicating that it was to be fully amortized over this 5-year period. However, there is also mention of a 10-year amortization period intended for Brevet A, suggesting a plan for its near-future sale. This discrepancy can be resolved by considering the 5-year period as the remaining amortization schedule at a specific point in time (the date of the merger), while the 10-year period may refer to the original or a revised amortization schedule based on strategic financial planning or reevaluation of the patent's useful life.\n\nFurthermore, Brevet A was ceded on 30/06/N+2, indicating a transaction or transfer of the patent rights occurred on this date. The mention of a latent tax considered for its latent gain implies that there were tax implications associated with the anticipated gain on the sale of Brevet A, reflecting the careful financial planning and consideration of tax effects on the patent's disposal.\n\nIn summary, Brevet A is a patent treated as an amortizable and depreciable asset in accounting, with a noted residual utilization period of 5 years at the merger's date, initially or subsequently adjusted to a 10-year amortization period for strategic reasons. The patent was part of a transaction on 30/06/N+2, with its latent gain subject to tax considerations, highlighting the financial and strategic planning involved in managing this intellectual property asset.\",4\r\n1041,ARTICLE 745-7,,2\r\n1617,NOTAIRE,\"Notaire plays a role in managing the deposit of guarantee for the real estate transaction, indicating their legal involvement in the process\",2\r\n585,FIFO,\"First-In, First-Out, a method used for the evaluation of the inventory and cost of goods sold\",2\r\n587,ART. 616-12,Article describing the interchangeable nature of obtained and acquired certificates and their evaluation methods,2\r\n586,CUMP,\"Coût Unitaire Moyen Pondéré, or Weighted Average Cost Method, used for inventory valuation in accounting\",2\r\n1349,TERRAINS,\"Covers various types of land including undeveloped land, developed land, subsoil and airspace rights, quarry lands, and lands with or without constructions owned by the entity\",3\r\n1350,AGENCEMENTS ET AMÉNAGEMENTS DE TERRAINS,\"Includes expenses for land development such as fencing and earth movements, categorized similarly to the account for land\",1\r\n1511,IMMEUBLES LOCATIFS,Rental buildings that are part of the real estate assets and are accounted for as tangible assets,1\r\n1034,LOGICIEL,\"Software asset with a 5-year amortization period, showing no latent gain due to unreliable estimation beyond its net book value\",1\r\n1038,OUTILLAGE,\"OUTILLAGE refers to the category of tools and equipment that are recognized for their practical utility in various operations. These assets are characterized by their presumed real value, which is at least equivalent to their net book value. This implies that while OUTILLAGE is considered valuable for its functional use, it is not typically associated with significant latent gains, meaning it does not hold hidden or unrealized increases in value beyond its recorded financial worth. Specifically, OUTILLAGE assets are subject to a 10-year amortization period, indicating that their cost is allocated over a decade, reflecting their expected useful life and the period over which they contribute to the generation of revenue. This amortization process is a standard accounting practice that helps in accurately representing the asset's decreasing value over time. In summary, OUTILLAGE encompasses tools and equipment deemed essential for operational purposes, with a financial evaluation that mirrors their book value and a structured approach to recognizing their cost over a ten-year lifespan, without anticipating substantial hidden financial gains.\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n553,CEE,RECUEIL DES NORMES COMPTABLES FRANÇAISES,\"The CEE (Certificats d'Économies d'Énergie) and the RECUEIL DES NORMES COMPTABLES FRANÇAISES are closely interconnected within the framework of French accounting standards. The RECUEIL DES NORMES COMPTABLES FRANÇAISES, a comprehensive collection of French accounting standards, meticulously outlines the regulatory framework and accounting treatment for obligations related to CEEs. This includes detailed guidance on the recognition of liabilities and the necessary documentation for energy savings obligations, ensuring that entities involved in CEE transactions adhere to the prescribed accounting practices.\n\nThe Recueil des Normes Comptables Françaises serves as an essential reference for entities engaged in CEE transactions, providing a clear and structured approach to the accounting aspects of these activities. It specifies how entities should document and recognize the financial implications of their energy savings efforts, thereby facilitating transparency and consistency in financial reporting related to CEEs. By integrating the regulatory requirements and accounting treatments of CEEs within its pages, the RECUEIL DES NORMES COMPTABLES FRANÇAISES plays a pivotal role in the governance and financial management of energy efficiency initiatives in France.\",559\r\n1122,FONDS COMMERCIAL,RECUEIL DES NORMES COMPTABLES FRANÇAISES,The goodwill's accounting treatment is governed by the French accounting standards,552\r\n1094,PERSONNE MORALE M,RECUEIL DES NORMES COMPTABLES FRANÇAISES,The control and operational changes of Personne Morale M over Entité A and B are described within the RECUEIL DES NORMES COMPTABLES FRANÇAISES,548\r\n1071,ENTITÉ A,ENTITÉ B,\"Entité A and Entité B have a complex and multifaceted relationship characterized by absorption, control, and collaboration in corporate operations. Entité A has absorbed Entité B, holding 60% of its titles, which signifies a direct ownership and operational relationship between the two entities. This absorption process involves evaluating Entité B's assets for the purpose of the merger, indicating a strategic approach to their consolidation. Despite the dominant role of Entité A in this relationship, Entité B also plays a significant part by contributing titles to Entité A, which not only affects their mutual control over another entity, presumably Entité C, but also showcases a form of reciprocity and partnership.\n\nMoreover, the relationship between Entité A and Entité B is not solely defined by the absorption and control dynamics. They also participate jointly in various operations involving control and asset valuation, highlighting a close collaborative relationship. This collaboration suggests that while Entité A may have a controlling interest in Entité B, both entities work together in a manner that benefits their mutual interests, possibly extending their influence or control over other entities like Entité C.\n\nIn resolving the apparent contradiction between Entité A's absorption of Entité B and Entité B's targeting of Entité A in operations, it becomes clear that the relationship is dynamic and involves a strategic interplay of control, asset valuation, and collaboration. Entité B's targeting of Entité A likely refers to strategic initiatives or operations aimed at influencing or guiding the merger and absorption process, rather than a hostile or competitive action.\n\nIn summary, Entité A and Entité B are engaged in a relationship that encompasses absorption, control, and collaboration. Entité A holds a controlling interest in Entité B through the ownership of 60% of its titles and plays a significant role in evaluating and integrating Entité B's assets. Despite this, Entité B actively contributes to the relationship by participating in operations that influence control over other entities and by engaging in joint operations with Entité A that underline their close collaboration and mutual strategic interests.\",29\r\n1082,ENTITÉ A,PERSONNE PHYSIQUE X,\"Personne Physique X contributes significantly to A, altering control over Entité C\",23\r\n1083,ENTITÉ A,MONSIEUR X,\"Monsieur X holds a position of significant influence and control over Entité A, a corporate entity that itself exercises control over Entité B and has a controlling interest in various other corporate entities.

Furthermore, Monsieur X's relationship with Entité A is deepened by his contribution of a business branch to it, indicating a direct and substantial involvement in its operations and strategic direction. This arrangement places Monsieur X at the helm of a network of corporate entities, with Entité A serving as the central node through which he exercises his influence and control.

An Organisme d'HLM, which is a type of housing organization in France dedicated to providing low-cost housing, received a prime, or financial incentive, related to Energy Savings Certificates (CEE) as part of an entity's obligations to promote energy conservation. This incentive was obtained by the Organisme d'HLM through the completion of energy-saving works, for which they were paid premiums by entities obligated under the CEE scheme. The CEE program is designed to encourage energy-saving measures by mandating certain entities to achieve energy savings targets, which can be fulfilled by supporting projects that reduce energy consumption, such as those undertaken by Organismes d'HLM. This collaboration not only underscores the commitment of both entities to enhancing energy efficiency but also highlights the financial mechanisms in place to support such initiatives, benefiting both the environment and the residents of the housing provided by the Organisme d'HLM.\",15\r\n580,CEE,FOURNISSEUR X,\"Fournisseur X is involved in the supply chain of Energy Savings Certificates, indicating a business relationship where CEE are transacted\",15\r\n1074,ENTITÉ B,ENTITÉ C,\"Entité B and Entité C have undergone significant changes in their corporate structure and control dynamics. Initially, Entité B takes control of Entité C in specific asset valuation scenarios, indicating a conditional power shift based on the financial performance or valuation of assets. This control is further solidified through a comprehensive merger process, during which Entité C transfers all its assets and liabilities to Entité B. This merger is not merely a transfer of control but a complete integration of Entité C into Entité B, effectively dissolving the former's independent corporate existence.\n\nThe relationship between Entité B and Entité C is characterized by operations of contributions and mergers, transitioning from a state of no control to joint control. This suggests that the merger process was perhaps phased or involved multiple stages, starting with collaborative ventures or partnerships that gradually increased Entité B's stake and influence over Entité C. The use of the term \"\"joint control\"\" implies that at some point during the transition, both entities shared control over the merged assets and operations before Entité C's complete absorption into Entité B.\n\nThis comprehensive description highlights a strategic consolidation process, where Entité B and Entité C moved from separate entities with their own assets and liabilities to a unified entity under the control of Entité B. The merger and asset/liability transfer indicate a deliberate effort to streamline operations, possibly to enhance competitive advantage, financial stability, or operational efficiency. The phased approach to control, starting with conditional scenarios and moving towards full integration, reflects a carefully managed transition designed to ensure seamless integration of resources, cultures, and operational frameworks.\",13\r\n1077,ENTITÉ C,ENTITÉ M,\"Entité C is indirectly under the control of Entité M through its control over Entités A, B, and D\",13\r\n558,PNCEE,CERTIFICATS D'ÉCONOMIES D'ÉNERGIE,The process for obtaining Certificats d'Économies d'Énergie involves submitting documentation to the PNCEE,12\r\n1088,ENTITÉ D,ENTITÉ M,Entité M exercises common control over Entité D,12\r\n576,ENTITÉ M,HLM,Entité M provides financial incentives to HLM for energy saving measures,11\r\n1089,ENTITÉ E,ENTITÉ M,Entité M exercises common control over Entité E,10\r\n1053,MALI TECHNIQUE,FONDS COMMERCIAL,The Fonds Commercial may be included in the calculation of the Mali Technique if it can be reliably evaluated and is justified by expected economic benefits,9\r\n1079,ENTITÉ M,\"ENTITÉS A, B, D\",\"Entités A, B, and D are under the ultimate control of Entité M\",9\r\n1085,ENTITÉ B,PP2,PP2 directly controls Entité B,9\r\n1104,BREVET B,TITRES DE PARTICIPATION,Both Patent B and Equity Participation assets have latent gains identified but no latent tax effects considered,9\r\n1105,IMPÔTS SUR DÉFICITS REPORTABLES,FONDS COMMERCIAL,Tax allocation for recoverable deficits is related to the valuation of goodwill in the context of mergers and acquisitions,9\r\n1314,DROIT AU BAIL,FONDS COMMERCIAL,Droit au bail is considered part of the intangible assets contributing to the Fonds commercial,8\r\n1103,BREVET A,TERRAIN,Both Patent A and Land are intended for near-future sale with latent tax effects considered,7\r\n1116,BREVET A,ARTICLE 745-7,The amortization of Brevet A is conducted in accordance with Article 745-7,6\r\n1528,SCP,NOTAIRE,Notaire's involvement in handling the deposit of guarantee suggests a legal relationship with SCP's real estate operation,6\r\n1529,HLM,NOTAIRE,\"Notaire is involved in the process where HLM manages the deposit for a T5 unit, indicating a procedural relationship\",5\r\n565,FIFO,ART. 616-12,Article 616-12 mentions FIFO as an evaluation method for CEEs,4\r\n566,CUMP,ART. 616-12,Article 616-12 mentions CUMP as an evaluation method for CEEs,4\r\n1318,TERRAINS,AGENCEMENTS ET AMÉNAGEMENTS DE TERRAINS,Land development expenses are categorized under the broader category of land assets,4\r\n1420,IMMEUBLES LOCATIFS,TERRAINS,\"Rental buildings are established on lands, which are accounted as tangible assets or inventory based on their intended use\",4\r\n1102,LOGICIEL,OUTILLAGE,Both Software and Tooling assets have real values considered at least equivalent to their net book values but with no significant latent gains identified,3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
