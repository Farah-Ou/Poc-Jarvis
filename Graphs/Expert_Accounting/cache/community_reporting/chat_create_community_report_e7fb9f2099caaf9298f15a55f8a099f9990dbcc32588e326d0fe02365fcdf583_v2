It is recognized as a commercial fund with a book value of 2,700 at the beginning of the year, which is not depreciated, and it has a net goodwill of 800 by the end of the year. This goodwill, which represents the value of acquired business elements that cannot be classified under other balance sheet items, is not accounted for in the absorbing entity's accounts. It is valued at 3,500 but is only recognized up to the allocated technical deficit of 2,700.\n\nGoodwill is a crucial component of FONDS COMMERCIAL, indicating the excess value of a business above its tangible assets and liabilities. It reflects the depreciation in value in the accounting records, showcasing a decrease in the intangible assets' worth over time. Despite this depreciation, goodwill is essential for representing the acquisition of intangible assets of a business that are not separately evaluated and accounted for on the balance sheet. These assets contribute significantly to the maintenance or development of the entity's activity potential.\n\nFurthermore, FONDS COMMERCIAL plays a vital role in the merger process by representing the intangible assets, specifically business goodwill, involved. This aspect underscores the importance of goodwill in enhancing a company's value beyond its physical assets and liabilities, thereby contributing to its overall market position and potential for growth. Through FONDS COMMERCIAL, businesses can quantify and leverage their intangible assets, such as customer relationships and brand reputation, which are critical for sustaining competitive advantage and fostering long-term success.\",7\r\n1001,MALI TECHNIQUE,\"The \"\"Mali Technique\"\" refers to a specialized financial accounting concept primarily associated with the French accounting standards. It encompasses the technical goodwill or negative goodwill that emerges from corporate mergers or acquisitions. This concept is crucial for understanding how latent gains or liabilities, which are not recorded in the absorbed entity's accounts, are calculated, allocated, and subsequently amortized. The Mali Technique is specifically tied to the treatment of technical goodwill, which involves a detailed process outlined within the \"\"RECUEIL DES NORMES COMPTABLES FRANÇAISES,\"\" a compendium of French accounting standards.\n\nThis accounting treatment is significant for its role in the amortization of technical goodwill, highlighting the intricate methodologies employed in the French accounting system to address the financial implications of corporate restructuring events. The Mali Technique's application ensures that financial statements accurately reflect the economic realities of mergers or acquisitions by identifying and quantifying goodwill or negative goodwill that may not be immediately apparent in the financial records of the entities involved.\n\nGiven its technical nature, the Mali Technique is an essential aspect of accounting practices that deal with the complexities arising from mergers or the universal transmission of assets. It serves as a critical tool for accountants and financial analysts in France, enabling them to adhere to national standards while ensuring that corporate financial disclosures provide a transparent and comprehensive view of an entity's financial health post-merger or acquisition. This technique underscores the importance of meticulous financial analysis and reporting in capturing the full scope of corporate transactions, particularly those involving significant structural changes.\",2\r\n1040,IMPÔTS SUR DÉFICITS REPORTABLES,\"The \"\"Impôts sur Déficits Reportables\"\" refers to the tax implications associated with recoverable deficits, specifically in the context of an entity that has been absorbed. This tax allocation takes into account the latent tax on short-term planned asset disposals. It is designed to address the financial treatment of carryforward losses, which are losses that a company can use to offset future profit to reduce its tax liability. As of January 1 of year N (denoted as 1/1/N), these carryforward losses were valued at 1,000 units of currency. Over the course of the year, 450 of these units were amortized. This means that a portion of the recoverable deficits was utilized or accounted for within the year's financial activities, reducing the total amount of losses that can be carried forward to offset taxable income in future periods. The mechanism serves as a critical financial tool for companies, allowing them to manage their tax liabilities more effectively by leveraging losses incurred in previous periods.\",2\r\n1341,DROIT AU BAIL,Amount paid or due to the previous tenant for the transfer of rights from agreements and commercial property legislation,1\r\n1349,TERRAINS,\"Covers various types of land including undeveloped land, developed land, subsoil and airspace rights, quarry lands, and lands with or without constructions owned by the entity\",3\r\n1350,AGENCEMENTS ET AMÉNAGEMENTS DE TERRAINS,\"Includes expenses for land development such as fencing and earth movements, categorized similarly to the account for land\",1\r\n1511,IMMEUBLES LOCATIFS,Rental buildings that are part of the real estate assets and are accounted for as tangible assets,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1122,FONDS COMMERCIAL,RECUEIL DES NORMES COMPTABLES FRANÇAISES,The goodwill's accounting treatment is governed by the French accounting standards,552\r\n1053,MALI TECHNIQUE,FONDS COMMERCIAL,The Fonds Commercial may be included in the calculation of the Mali Technique if it can be reliably evaluated and is justified by expected economic benefits,9\r\n1105,IMPÔTS SUR DÉFICITS REPORTABLES,FONDS COMMERCIAL,Tax allocation for recoverable deficits is related to the valuation of goodwill in the context of mergers and acquisitions,9\r\n1314,DROIT AU BAIL,FONDS COMMERCIAL,Droit au bail is considered part of the intangible assets contributing to the Fonds commercial,8\r\n1318,TERRAINS,AGENCEMENTS ET AMÉNAGEMENTS DE TERRAINS,Land development expenses are categorized under the broader category of land assets,4\r\n1420,IMMEUBLES LOCATIFS,TERRAINS,\"Rental buildings are established on lands, which are accounted as tangible assets or inventory based on their intended use\",4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
