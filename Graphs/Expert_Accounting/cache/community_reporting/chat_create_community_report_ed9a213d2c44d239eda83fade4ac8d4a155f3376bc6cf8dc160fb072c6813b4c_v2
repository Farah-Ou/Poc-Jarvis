This law modified existing legal and fiscal provisions to facilitate the use of PPP contracts. By adjusting the framework to be more accommodating, the French government aimed to make PPPs a more attractive option for the design, construction, and provision of public works. The significance of this law lies in its attempt to streamline the process and reduce the complexities involved in initiating PPP projects.

This contractual mechanism encompasses financing, design, construction, and operation, offering a holistic solution to public needs. The introduction of LOI N° 2008-735 further enhanced the attractiveness and feasibility of these contracts by modifying legal provisions to support their use in public procurement. The PPP contract is a cornerstone in France's strategy to involve the private sector in public development projects, reflecting a broader trend towards leveraging private expertise and resources for public benefit.

This legal adjustment is crucial as it addresses the fiscal implications of PPPs, thereby making these contracts more financially viable and attractive to private operators. By clarifying and extending tax provisions, the law mitigates some of the financial risks and uncertainties that previously deterred private entities from engaging in PPPs. This change underscores the government's commitment to creating a conducive environment for PPPs, recognizing their potential to contribute significantly to public infrastructure and services.

This legislative move is indicative of a strategic shift towards more flexible and innovative approaches to public project financing and execution. By facilitating the use of PPPs, the law not only expands the toolkit available for public authorities in project development but also opens up new opportunities for private sector participation. This is a clear signal of the government's intention to leverage private sector efficiencies and capabilities in delivering public goods, which is a critical aspect of modern governance and public administration.
