Their primary function is to facilitate financial equalization among member cooperatives. This is achieved through a system where funds are collected by making deductions from the prices of contributions. These deductions are then pooled together to create a financial reserve. The purpose of this reserve is to provide support to members during periods when market prices are lower than usual, thereby ensuring stability and sustainability within the cooperative network.\n\nBy operating on the principle of price equalization, the Caisses de Péréquation help in maintaining a level of economic balance among the cooperatives. This system not only aids in cushioning the impact of market volatility on individual members but also strengthens the cooperative movement as a whole by fostering a spirit of mutual support and solidarity. Through their activities, these organizations contribute significantly to the resilience and competitiveness of agricultural cooperatives, ensuring that members can weather financial challenges and continue to thrive in a fluctuating market environment.\",2\r\n1767,UNIONS DE COOPÉRATIVES,Unions of cooperatives involved in agricultural activities and financial transactions,2\r\n1730,CAISSES DE PÉRÉQUATION INDIVIDUELLES,Individual accounts within cooperatives for managing price equalization contributions from members,1\r\n1731,CAISSES COLLECTIVES,\"Collective funds within cooperatives for compensation, equalization, or other purposes, supported by member contributions\",1\r\n1768,COOPÉRATIVES,,1\r\n1485,COMPTES DE PRODUITS,\"\"\"COMPTES DE PRODUITS\"\" refers to a specific category within the French accounting system that encompasses a comprehensive range of accounts detailing various income streams for cooperatives and similar entities. These accounts are meticulously organized to capture the income generated from a wide array of activities, including but not limited to sales, services, and other operational endeavors that form the backbone of a cooperative's financial inflow. The scope of \"\"COMPTES DE PRODUITS\"\" is not limited to the operational or primary activities of an entity; it also extends to cover financial income and exceptional income, thereby providing a holistic view of an entity's financial performance.\n\nThis categorization is integral to the French accounting framework, designed to ensure clarity and precision in financial reporting. By segregating income into normal and current operating income, financial income, and exceptional income, \"\"COMPTES DE PRODUITS\"\" allows for a nuanced understanding of an entity's financial health and operational efficiency. Normal and current operating income encapsulates the regular and expected revenue streams from the core activities of the cooperative, such as sales of goods or provision of services. Financial income includes revenue from investments, interest received, and other financial activities that contribute to the entity's profitability beyond its primary operations. Exceptional income captures irregular or one-off financial gains that are not part of the entity's routine business activities, providing insight into extraordinary events or transactions that impact the financial statements.\n\nOverall, \"\"COMPTES DE PRODUITS\"\" plays a crucial role in the French accounting system by offering a detailed and structured approach to recording and analyzing the diverse income sources of cooperatives and similar entities. This ensures that stakeholders have a clear and comprehensive understanding of where and how income is generated, supporting informed decision-making and effective financial management.\",1\r\n1775,CLASSE 6 COMPTES DE CHARGES,,1\r\n1774,CLASSE 7 COMPTES DE PRODUITS,\"A classification for accounts that record the income from sales, services, and other operations of cooperatives\",1\r\n1773,COOPÉRATEURS,Entities involved in various activities including collecte-vente (collection-sale) and approvisionnement (supply) as well as financial operations on their behalf,2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1694,ASSOCIÉS COOPÉRATEURS,CAPITAL ET RÉSERVES,Cooperative members contribute to the capital and reserves of agricultural cooperatives,20\r\n1634,CAISSES DE PÉRÉQUATION,ASSOCIÉS COOPÉRATEURS,Associés coopérateurs contribute to and benefit from the caisses de péréquation for price stabilization,18\r\n1705,UNIONS DE COOPÉRATIVES,ASSOCIÉS COOPÉRATEURS,\"Unions of cooperatives engage in financial transactions with their members, associés coopérateurs\",18\r\n1638,CAISSES DE PÉRÉQUATION INDIVIDUELLES,ASSOCIÉS COOPÉRATEURS,Caisse de péréquation individuelles are specific accounts for associés coopérateurs to manage their contributions and benefits,17\r\n1639,CAISSES COLLECTIVES,ASSOCIÉS COOPÉRATEURS,Caisse collectives are managed for and by associés coopérateurs for various financial support mechanisms,17\r\n1707,ASSOCIÉS COOPÉRATEURS,COOPÉRATIVES,\"Cooperatives have financial transactions such as loans and interests with their members, the associés coopérateurs\",17\r\n1719,ASSOCIÉS COOPÉRATEURS,COMPTES DE PRODUITS,Comptes de produits detail the income from the activities of associés coopérateurs,17\r\n1720,ASSOCIÉS COOPÉRATEURS,CLASSE 6 COMPTES DE CHARGES,The Classe 6 Comptes de Charges includes transactions and financial activities related to associés coopérateurs,17\r\n1721,ASSOCIÉS COOPÉRATEURS,CLASSE 7 COMPTES DE PRODUITS,The Classe 7 Comptes de Produits includes sales and service transactions related to associés coopérateurs,17\r\n1716,COOPÉRATEURS,ORGANISMES COOPÉRATIFS AGRICOLES,Coopérateurs engage with organismes coopératifs agricoles for agricultural activities and financial transactions,14\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
