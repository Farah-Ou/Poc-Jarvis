These entities play a crucial role in the housing sector by managing social housing units and are instrumental in ensuring that affordable housing options are available to those in need. They are eligible for state-aided loans, which are a significant source of funding for the construction, acquisition, or improvement of rental housing properties. Through these loans, HLM organizations are able to offer rental housing at reduced rates compared to the market, thereby fulfilling their mission to provide accessible and affordable housing solutions. Their operations encompass a wide range of activities, including but not limited to, the development of new housing projects, maintenance and improvement of existing housing stock, and the administration of rental agreements. By doing so, they contribute significantly to the social housing landscape, ensuring that individuals and families with limited income have access to decent, affordable living spaces.\",6\r\n92,CODE GÉNÉRAL DES IMPÔTS,,6\r\n486,CAISSE DES DÉPÔTS ET CONSIGNATIONS,\"The Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations is a pivotal French public sector financial institution, renowned for its extensive involvement in managing a variety of public interest activities. This institution plays a crucial role in the financial landscape of France by centralizing and managing tax apprenticeship funds, which are essential for the development and support of apprenticeships across the country. It is responsible for implementing a dematerialized service, a modern and efficient approach to the allocation of funds related to apprenticeship contributions. This streamlined process ensures that beneficiary organizations receive the necessary financial support in a timely and efficient manner.\n\nBeyond its significant role in managing apprenticeship funds, the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations also extends its financial expertise to the housing sector. It provides financing for new constructions and improvement works, offering locative loans that facilitate the development of housing projects. This aspect of its operations underscores the institution's commitment to contributing to the social and economic well-being of the French public through various means.\n\nIn summary, the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations stands as a cornerstone of the French public sector's financial infrastructure. Its dual role in both managing apprenticeship tax funds and supporting housing development through locative loans exemplifies its multifaceted approach to public service. By efficiently allocating resources to beneficiary organizations and facilitating significant construction and improvement projects, the institution significantly contributes to the growth and development of France's social and economic landscape.\",4\r\n488,CENTRES DE FORMATION D'APPRENTIS,\"Centres de Formation d'Apprentis (CFA) are specialized training centers dedicated to providing apprenticeship training. These centers play a crucial role in vocational education, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical skills. They receive significant support from employers, who contribute to the centers in various forms to ensure that the training provided is both relevant and of high quality. One of the primary ways through which CFAs receive support is through funds and equipment donated by employers. This not only aids in the practical training of apprentices by giving them access to up-to-date tools and materials but also helps in maintaining the infrastructure of the centers.\n\nAdditionally, CFAs benefit from subsidies in the form of equipment or materials, which are part of the balance of the apprenticeship tax. This tax is a financial mechanism designed to funnel resources directly into vocational training, ensuring that apprenticeship centers have the necessary resources to operate effectively. The balance of the apprenticeship tax thus serves as a direct funding source for CFAs, covering expenses related to the training programs. This system ensures that the centers are well-equipped and financially supported to provide high-quality training to apprentices, preparing them for successful careers in their chosen fields.\n\nIn summary, Centres de Formation d'Apprentis are vital institutions in the vocational education landscape, receiving substantial support from employers and benefiting from the apprenticeship tax. This support comes in the form of both direct funding for expenses and contributions of equipment or materials, ensuring that CFAs are well-prepared to offer comprehensive and practical training to apprentices.\",4\r\n485,URSSAF,\"URSSAF stands for the French organizations tasked with a critical role in the country's social security framework. These entities are primarily responsible for the collection of social security and family benefit contributions, ensuring that both employee and employer social security contributions, as well as social charges, are gathered efficiently. Their responsibilities extend beyond the mere collection of contributions; URSSAF is also involved in collecting the apprenticeship tax, which supports vocational training and apprenticeship programs. Additionally, their scope of work includes collaboration with agricultural social security funds, highlighting their integral role in the broader social security system in France. This comprehensive approach ensures that various aspects of social security and benefits are managed effectively, supporting the welfare state's functioning and providing essential services to the French population. Through their meticulous work, URSSAF plays a pivotal role in maintaining the social fabric of France, ensuring that social security contributions are collected and managed efficiently to support the nation's social welfare programs.\",4\r\n219,ARTICLE 214-13,\"Article 214-13 is a regulation that plays a crucial role in the context of amortization rules and fiscal duration definitions. It specifically addresses the use of useful life for creating amortization schedules for both tangible and intangible assets. This article is essential for businesses and financial entities as it outlines the guidelines on how to systematically reduce the value of these assets over time for accounting and tax purposes. By providing a framework for the calculation of depreciation, Article 214-13 ensures that companies can accurately reflect the wearing out, consumption, or other reductions in the useful life of their physical and non-physical assets. This, in turn, affects financial statements and tax liabilities, making it a critical piece of legislation for financial planning and compliance.\",1\r\n239,BOI-BIC-PVMV-40-10-60-30-20210609,\"A specific bulletin or directive within the French tax code, relevant to the revaluation of assets and their tax implications\",1\r\n513,MINISTRE CHARGÉ DE LA FORMATION PROFESSIONNELLE,,1\r\n1307,PÔLE EMPLOI,French governmental agency responsible for providing employment services and paying unemployment benefits,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1442,ORGANISMES D'HABITATIONS À LOYER MODÉRÉ (HLM),RECUEIL DES NORMES COMPTABLES FRANÇAISES,HLM organizations follow the accounting standards set by the Recueil des Normes Comptables Françaises,551\r\n58,AUTORITÉ DES NORMES COMPTABLES,CODE GÉNÉRAL DES IMPÔTS,The Code Général des Impôts contains provisions that are relevant to the accounting standards set by the Autorité des Normes Comptables,21\r\n445,CAISSE DES DÉPÔTS ET CONSIGNATIONS,CENTRES DE FORMATION D'APPRENTIS,The Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations implements a dematerialized service for allocating funds to Centres de Formation d'Apprentis,8\r\n461,CENTRES DE FORMATION D'APPRENTIS,URSSAF,Centres de Formation d'Apprentis receive funds collected by URSSAF,8\r\n463,URSSAF,CAISSE DES DÉPÔTS ET CONSIGNATIONS,URSSAF collects the apprenticeship tax which is then centralized by the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations,8\r\n170,ARTICLE 214-13,CODE GÉNÉRAL DES IMPÔTS,Article 214-13 specifies amortization durations as defined in the Code Général des Impôts,7\r\n195,BOI-BIC-PVMV-40-10-60-30-20210609,CODE GÉNÉRAL DES IMPÔTS,The bulletin BOI-BIC-PVMV-40-10-60-30-20210609 provides specific guidance on tax implications under the Code Général des Impôts,7\r\n462,CENTRES DE FORMATION D'APPRENTIS,MINISTRE CHARGÉ DE LA FORMATION PROFESSIONNELLE,The training centers must follow modalities set by the Minister Chargé de la Formation Professionnelle for the receipt of goods,5\r\n1281,URSSAF,PÔLE EMPLOI,Both URSSAF and Pôle Emploi are involved in the collection of social contributions and unemployment services in France,5\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
