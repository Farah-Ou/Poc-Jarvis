This method's significance lies in its impact on cost of goods sold (COGS) and ultimately on a company's gross margin. During periods of inflation, FIFO can result in lower COGS and higher reported profits compared to other methods. This can affect a company's financial health perception and tax liabilities.

This method smooths out price fluctuations over the accounting period, providing a more stable view of cost of goods sold and inventory costs. It's particularly useful for companies with large amounts of inventory or those that cannot easily track individual item costs.
