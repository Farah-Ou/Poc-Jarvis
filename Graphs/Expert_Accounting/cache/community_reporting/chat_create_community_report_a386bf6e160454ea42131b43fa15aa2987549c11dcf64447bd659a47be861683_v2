To comply with this regulation, companies must submit detailed technical documentation for each substance, demonstrating its safety for human health and the environment. Additionally, the process requires the payment of a fee. The agency's responsibilities encompass not only the initial registration of chemicals but also their ongoing evaluation to monitor and mitigate any potential risks they may pose.
