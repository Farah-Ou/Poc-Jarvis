These assets are characterized by their presumed real value, which is at least equivalent to their net book value. This implies that while OUTILLAGE is considered valuable for its functional use, it is not typically associated with significant latent gains, meaning it does not hold hidden or unrealized increases in value beyond its recorded financial worth. Specifically, OUTILLAGE assets are subject to a 10-year amortization period, indicating that their cost is allocated over a decade, reflecting their expected useful life and the period over which they contribute to the generation of revenue. This amortization process is a standard accounting practice that helps in accurately representing the asset's decreasing value over time.
