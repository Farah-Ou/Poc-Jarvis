This guideline is multifaceted, addressing both the non-recognition of certain losses and the conditions under which actuarial losses must be immediately recognized. Specifically, PARAGRAPHE 6121 outlines the immediate recognition of actuarial losses when they exceed reductions in economic benefits, thereby providing a clear framework for calculating unrecognized losses and the asset ceiling. Additionally, it encompasses the deferral of actuarial gains and losses, indicating a balanced approach to the timing of recognizing these financial impacts.\n\nThe provision is designed to ensure that financial statements accurately reflect the financial position of entities, particularly in relation to pension obligations. By stipulating the immediate recognition of significant actuarial losses, PARAGRAPHE 6121 aims to prevent the overstatement of pension assets and ensure that the financial statements present a realistic view of an entity's obligations. Conversely, the guideline's allowance for the deferral of actuarial gains and losses under certain conditions acknowledges the long-term nature of pension funding and the potential volatility in pension obligations due to changes in actuarial assumptions.\n\nIn summary, PARAGRAPHE 6121 within the French accounting standards represents a comprehensive approach to the accounting treatment of actuarial gains and losses. It balances the need for immediate recognition of substantial losses that affect the economic benefits of entities with the practical considerations of managing long-term pension obligations. This provision ensures that entities' financial statements provide a transparent and accurate picture of their financial health in relation to pension plans.\",5\r\n410,PARAGRAPHE 6125A,\"PARAGRAPHE 6125A is a specific guideline within the French accounting standards that plays a crucial role in the treatment of actuarial gains and losses, as well as the recognition of economic benefits available to a company. This guideline emphasizes the immediate recognition of actuarial gains while also adjusting asset ceilings to reflect these changes accurately. It explicitly prohibits the recognition of profit or loss that arises solely from past service costs, actuarial gains, or losses. This provision is aimed at maintaining the integrity of financial reporting by ensuring that gains or losses due to past service costs or actuarial gains/losses are not recognized in isolation.\n\nFurthermore, PARAGRAPHE 6125A addresses the complexity involved in recognizing economic benefits and actuarial losses under certain conditions. This includes a detailed discussion on the conditions under which economic benefits can be recognized and the impact of actuarial losses on such recognitions. The guideline serves to clarify the accounting treatment of these elements, ensuring that companies adhere to a standard approach that prevents the manipulation of financial statements through the selective recognition of gains or losses.\n\nOverall, PARAGRAPHE 6125A is integral to the French accounting standards, providing clear rules and provisions that guide companies in the accurate and fair presentation of their financial position. By addressing the immediate recognition of actuarial gains, adjusting asset ceilings, and prohibiting the isolated recognition of gains or losses from past service costs and actuarial events, it ensures that financial statements reflect the true economic reality of a company's situation.\",5\r\n412,AVANTAGES ÉCONOMIQUES DISPONIBLES,\"Refers to the economic benefits available to a company, a key concept in the accounting standards that affects the recognition of actuarial losses\",2\r\n416,ANNÉE 2,\"The second year in the examples provided within the French accounting standards, showing the subsequent conditions and outcomes after actuarial gains and changes in economic benefits\",2\r\n415,ACTIFS DU BILAN,,1\r\n417,ANNÉE 1,,1\r\n418,PARAGRAPHE 6125(B),A provision within the French accounting standards related to the cap on asset recognition and the determination of economic benefits,1\r\n411,EXCÉDENT DU RÉGIME,\"Refers to the surplus in a scheme or plan, as mentioned in the example of adjusting for actuarial losses and changes in economic benefits\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n362,PARAGRAPHE 6121,PARAGRAPHE 6125A,\"Paragraph 6125A builds upon the guidelines set by Paragraph 6121, specifying conditions under which actuarial gains and losses are recognized\",10\r\n366,PARAGRAPHE 6125A,AVANTAGES ÉCONOMIQUES DISPONIBLES,\"The economic benefits available to the company are a central consideration in Paragraph 6125A, which discusses the conditions under which these benefits and related losses are recognized\",7\r\n370,PARAGRAPHE 6121,ANNÉE 2,\"The guidelines of Paragraph 6121 are applied to the conditions and calculations of the second year's accounting treatments, including the immediate recognition of actuarial gains\",7\r\n365,PARAGRAPHE 6121,ACTIFS DU BILAN,\"The balance sheet assets are directly affected by the application of Paragraph 6121, which deals with the immediate recognition of actuarial losses\",6\r\n369,PARAGRAPHE 6121,ANNÉE 1,The guidelines of Paragraph 6121 are applied to the conditions and calculations of the first year's accounting treatments,6\r\n373,PARAGRAPHE 6125A,PARAGRAPHE 6125(B),Paragraph 6125A is applied in the context of asset cap and economic benefits as outlined in Paragraph 6125(b),6\r\n367,EXCÉDENT DU RÉGIME,AVANTAGES ÉCONOMIQUES DISPONIBLES,\"The surplus in the scheme is related to the economic benefits available to the company, as both are considered in the calculation of assets and losses\",3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
