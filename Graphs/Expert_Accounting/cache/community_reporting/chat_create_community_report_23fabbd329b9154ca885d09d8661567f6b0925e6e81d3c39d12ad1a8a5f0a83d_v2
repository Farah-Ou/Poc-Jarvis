Among these, regulation number 02-10 is notable for its impact on asset depreciation and amortization practices, highlighting the CRC's influence on the minutiae of accounting procedures. Additionally, the CRC is responsible for regulation n° 99-07, which addresses financial accounting and reporting standards, underscoring its commitment to maintaining rigorous financial transparency and accountability.\n\nThe CRC's regulatory scope also extends to the foundational aspects of accounting, as demonstrated by regulation n° 2004-06, which outlines the criteria for asset definition, recognition, and valuation.
