It mandates the recording of transactions that affect a company's assets and outlines specific requirements for different types of businesses, such as the confidentiality of annual accounts for micro-enterprises and small businesses.\n\nFurthermore, the Code de Commerce provides guidelines for the issuance of stock options to employees and directors, and it addresses transactions between related parties, ensuring transparency and fairness in commercial dealings. It includes provisions for the evaluation of exploration and evaluation expenses in the mining sector, highlighting its adaptability to various industry requirements.

These certificates play a crucial role in the framework, serving as a tangible representation of energy savings achieved and are an essential tool for monitoring and encouraging energy efficiency improvements across different sectors.

The DGEC's work involves the creation and management of Energy Savings Certificates (CEEs), a key tool in the country's energy policy framework. These certificates are issued following the successful completion of energy-saving actions, which are detailed through standardized operation sheets or tailored to individual procedures for specific operations. By doing so, the DGEC not only promotes the reduction of energy consumption but also incentivizes organizations and individuals to undertake measures that contribute to the broader goals of energy efficiency and climate change mitigation.
