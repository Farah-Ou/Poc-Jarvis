It is a governmental financial institution responsible for the administration of government revenue and expenditure. One of its key responsibilities includes the enforcement of energy saving obligations. The Trésor Public is actively involved in the process of ensuring companies meet their energy saving obligations, either through the purchase of energy saving certificates (CEEs) or by making direct payments. This involvement includes the collection of liberatory payments from energy sellers who fail to return CEEs in a timely manner.\n\nFurthermore, the Trésor Public is tasked with the collection of payments related to penalties for non-compliance with environmental regulations. This includes fines and other financial penalties imposed on entities that do not fulfill their obligations related to energy savings. The institution plays a significant role in the compensation process for unmet energy saving obligations, thereby contributing to France's broader environmental and energy efficiency goals.\n\nIn summary, the Trésor Public is a pivotal entity in France's financial and environmental landscape, overseeing the collection of payments and fines related to energy saving obligations and environmental non-compliance.

This government authority is also recognized for publishing a list of organizations involved in lifelong guidance services, highlighting its involvement in educational and professional development initiatives.\n\nAs a source of investment subsidies for agricultural cooperatives, ÉTAT's contributions are essential for the development and support of this sector, ensuring that cooperatives have the necessary resources to thrive. The entity's role extends beyond financial support, encompassing a broader responsibility for public funding, tax collection, and the overall management of the state's fiscal policies.
