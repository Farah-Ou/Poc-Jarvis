This regulation meticulously outlines the initial evaluation of tangible and intangible assets as well as inventory, ensuring that the valuation of these assets is consistent and transparent across the board. Furthermore, Article 213-1 addresses the treatment of assets acquired at no cost, stipulating that such assets must be recorded at their fair value at the time of acquisition. This provision ensures that the financial statements of an entity reflect a true and fair view of its asset base, regardless of the manner in which assets are acquired. By mandating the recording of free assets at their fair value, Article 213-1 helps in maintaining the integrity of financial reporting and aids stakeholders in making informed decisions based on the financial statements.\",2\r\n864,DROITS D’EXPLOITATION AUDIOVISUELLE,\"Rights related to the use and exploitation of audiovisual content, considered as intangible assets under French accounting standards\",5\r\n866,ARTICLE 211-5,,1\r\n865,ARTICLES 212-1 AND 212-2,\"Detail the conditions under which an intangible asset can be recognized on the balance sheet, focusing on the future economic benefits and the reliability of cost or value estimation\",1\r\n842,ARTICLE 214-6,\"Article 214-6 is a regulation or clause within the French accounting standards that plays a crucial role in the evaluation of future economic benefits for assets. This regulation is specifically designed to guide entities in accurately determining the value of their assets, ensuring that the financial statements reflect a true and fair view of the entity's financial position. Article 214-6 defines the concept of fair value, which is essential for the valuation of assets, especially in situations where an active market for those assets does not exist.\n\nThe regulation outlines a comprehensive method for asset valuation, providing entities with a framework to estimate the fair value of their assets based on the best available information. This includes considering future economic benefits that the assets are expected to generate. The importance of Article 214-6 lies in its ability to standardize the approach to asset valuation across entities, promoting consistency and comparability in financial reporting within the French accounting context.\n\nBy defining fair value and specifying how to approach asset valuation in the absence of an active market, Article 214-6 ensures that entities have a clear guideline to follow.
