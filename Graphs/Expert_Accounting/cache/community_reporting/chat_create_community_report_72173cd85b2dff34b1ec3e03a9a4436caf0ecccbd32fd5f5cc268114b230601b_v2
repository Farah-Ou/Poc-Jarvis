This classification encompasses a broad range of assets, including intangible assets, tangible assets, and financial assets. These are assets that are entered into an entity's heritage, which means they are considered long-term investments or possessions that the entity plans to hold rather than convert into cash in the short term. The accounts under \"\"COMPTES D'IMMOBILISATIONS\"\" detail the financial value of these assets in various forms, such as their acquisition cost, production cost, and the value of contributions. This comprehensive approach ensures that all aspects of an asset's financial value are accounted for, from the initial purchase or production to any contributions made towards its acquisition or improvement. This classification is crucial for accurate financial reporting and analysis, providing a clear view of the entity's investment in fixed assets and its long-term financial health.\",9\r\n111,FRAIS D'ÉTABLISSEMENT,\"Establishment costs, representing expenses incurred in setting up or expanding the company, which can be capitalized\",1\r\n1343,PRODUCTION IMMOBILISÉE,\"\"\"PRODUCTION IMMOBILISÉE\"\" refers to the cost of work performed by the entity for its own use, which is recorded as an asset on its balance sheet. This encompasses production costs that are capitalized, meaning they are not expensed in the period they are incurred but are instead treated as part of the entity's assets. This accounting practice allows the entity to spread the cost of the production over its useful life, reflecting the consumption of the asset's value over time. Essentially, \"\"PRODUCTION IMMOBILISÉE\"\" represents an investment in the entity's own operational capabilities or infrastructure, which is expected to provide economic benefits in future periods.
