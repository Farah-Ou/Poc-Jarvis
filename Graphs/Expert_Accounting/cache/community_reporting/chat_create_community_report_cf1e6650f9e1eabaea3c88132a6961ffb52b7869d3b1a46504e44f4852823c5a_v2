This regulation is a key piece of legislation within the French accounting standards framework, designed to guide the preparation and presentation of consolidated financial statements. One notable aspect of Règlement ANC N° 2020-01 is its lack of a specific definition for exceptional results. This omission necessitates that individuals and entities looking to understand or apply the regulation in this context must refer to the broader French accounting standards for interpretation and guidance.\n\nFurthermore, Règlement ANC N° 2020-01 addresses the treatment of both internal and external costs that are related to acquisitions and the issuance of titles. This inclusion highlights the regulation's comprehensive approach to ensuring that the financial statements of groups of companies reflect a true and fair view of their financial position and performance, particularly in the context of complex financial transactions such as acquisitions and emissions of titles.\n\nOverall, Règlement ANC N° 2020-01 serves as a critical component of the regulatory framework governing consolidated accounts in France, emphasizing the importance of clarity, accuracy, and consistency in financial reporting.
