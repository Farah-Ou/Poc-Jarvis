However, it currently presents some limitations in its functionality. Notably, JAWS has incomplete or missing support for the accessible name calculation for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) links. This issue can hinder the ability of users to fully interact with or navigate through web content that employs SVG elements for links, potentially impacting the user experience for individuals relying on this technology for web accessibility.\n\nAdditionally, JAWS offers incomplete support for Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) roles. WAI-ARIA roles are essential for defining the type of user interface elements on web pages, which in turn helps screen readers like JAWS interpret and convey these elements accurately to users. The lack of comprehensive support for WAI-ARIA roles by JAWS affects accessibility navigation, as it may not correctly interpret or announce the roles of certain elements on a webpage. This limitation can further complicate the browsing experience for users with visual impairments, making it challenging for them to understand the structure and navigate the content of complex web pages effectively.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, JAWS remains a critical tool in the field of web accessibility, enabling users with visual impairments to access and interact with digital content. The ongoing development and updates to JAWS are essential for addressing these issues, ensuring that it continues to meet the evolving standards of web accessibility and serves the needs of its users more effectively.\",3\r\n122,NVDA,\"NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) is a screen reader technology designed to assist users, particularly those with visual impairments, in navigating desktop environments. It plays a crucial role in desktop testing environments for accessibility, ensuring that applications and websites are accessible to all users, including those who rely on screen readers for interaction. However, NVDA has been identified to have incomplete or missing support for the accessible name calculation for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) links. This limitation can hinder the ability of users to fully interact with graphics-intensive content, as the screen reader may not accurately convey the information or functionality represented by SVG elements. Additionally, NVDA exhibits lacunary support for Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) roles. This gap in functionality impacts users' navigation experience, as WAI-ARIA roles are critical for conveying the structure, functionality, and interactivity of web content to assistive technologies. Despite these challenges, NVDA remains a vital tool in the accessibility landscape, offering users with visual impairments a means to access and interact with digital content. Efforts to enhance its support for SVG links and WAI-ARIA roles could significantly improve the navigation experience for users, making digital environments more inclusive and accessible to everyone.\",3\r\n147,FIREFOX,A browser used in various testing combinations for accessibility evaluation,2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n126,WAI-ARIA,JAWS,\"JAWS has incomplete support for WAI-ARIA roles, affecting accessibility\",24\r\n127,WAI-ARIA,NVDA,\"NVDA provides lacunary support for WAI-ARIA roles, impacting web navigation for users\",24\r\n159,FIREFOX,NVDA,NVDA is used with Firefox in desktop testing environments for accessibility,5\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
