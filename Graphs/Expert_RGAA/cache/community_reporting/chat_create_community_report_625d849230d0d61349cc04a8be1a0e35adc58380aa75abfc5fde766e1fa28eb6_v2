This language is essential for web development as it dictates how elements within a document should be rendered across various media, including on-screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. CSS plays a crucial role in web accessibility, ensuring that content is accessible across different user agents, including browsers and assistive technologies. By allowing developers to separate the presentation style of documents from the content itself, CSS facilitates web design and content management, making it easier to maintain and update websites. Its compatibility with accessibility standards ensures that websites can be used by a wider audience, including those with disabilities. This comprehensive approach to web presentation and accessibility underscores the importance of CSS in creating visually appealing and universally accessible web content.\",4\r\n123,XHTML,\"XHTML is a stricter version of HTML, offering more web standards compliance\",3\r\n25,JAVASCRIPT,\"JavaScript is a versatile programming language that adheres to the ECMAScript specification, playing a crucial role in web development by enabling programmatic access to computational objects within various host environments. It is widely recognized for its ability to create dynamic and interactive web content, making it an indispensable tool for web developers. As a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is embedded in most web browsers. This integration allows for client-side scripting, where JavaScript interacts directly with users, controls the browser operations, facilitates asynchronous communication, and modifies the content displayed on web pages. Its functionality extends beyond merely enhancing the user interface to include features that can dynamically update content, handle multimedia, animate images, and much more, all aimed at improving the user experience on the internet. Through its comprehensive capabilities, JavaScript has established itself as a fundamental language that supports the development of highly interactive and responsive web pages.\",5\r\n110,CAPTCHA,A CAPTCHA is a type of challenge-response test used in computing to determine whether or not the user is human,1\r\n129,AJAX,\"AJAX, Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n109,HTML,WAI-ARIA,\"HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications) are closely related technologies that work together to enhance web accessibility for users with disabilities. HTML, the standard markup language used to create web pages, can be significantly enhanced through the integration of WAI-ARIA attributes and roles. These enhancements are designed to improve the accessibility of web content and web applications, making them more usable for individuals with various disabilities.\n\nWAI-ARIA attributes provide detailed information about the role, state, and functionality of web elements. By incorporating these attributes into HTML elements, developers can convey the purpose and behavior of these elements more clearly to assistive technologies, such as screen readers. This is particularly important for dynamic content and advanced user interface components developed with HTML, which may not be fully accessible or understandable to users with disabilities without the additional context provided by WAI-ARIA.\n\nSimilarly, WAI-ARIA roles define the specific role of an element within the web page structure, such as a button, slider, or alert. These roles help assistive technologies interpret the elements correctly, ensuring that users with disabilities can navigate and interact with web content more effectively. By specifying roles, developers can make the semantic purpose of elements explicit, bridging any gaps in accessibility that might exist due to the inherent limitations of HTML elements alone.\n\nIn summary, the integration of WAI-ARIA attributes and roles into HTML elements is a critical practice for enhancing web accessibility. This collaboration between HTML and WAI-ARIA ensures that web content and applications are more accessible and usable for people with disabilities, promoting a more inclusive digital environment. Through careful implementation of WAI-ARIA's detailed roles and attributes, developers can create rich, interactive web experiences that are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities.\",31\r\n113,CSS,WAI-ARIA,\"While WAI-ARIA primarily interacts with HTML to enhance accessibility, CSS can be used to visually style the accessible components defined by WAI-ARIA\",25\r\n128,WAI-ARIA,XHTML,WAI-ARIA roles and attributes can also be utilized within XHTML documents,24\r\n134,JAVASCRIPT,HTML,JavaScript is used to manipulate HTML documents to enhance user interaction and functionality,15\r\n110,HTML,CAPTCHA,CAPTCHAs are implemented on web pages using HTML forms,11\r\n143,HTML,AJAX,HTML content can be dynamically updated using AJAX techniques without needing to reload the page,11\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
