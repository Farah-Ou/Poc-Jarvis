It is designed to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content and applications, making them more accessible to people with disabilities. This set of standards specifies how to make web content, particularly dynamic content and user interface components developed with technologies such as Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies, more accessible.\n\nThe framework includes a variety of roles, attributes, and guidelines that define how to enhance web accessibility. For instance, WAI-ARIA introduces roles for defining accessibility attributes and landmarks in web documents, which significantly aids screen reader users and facilitates keyboard navigation. It allows for the definition of headings through the role \"\"heading\"\" and the attribute \"\"aria-level,\"\" indicating the level of the title. Although it provides compatibility with accessibility standards, there is a preference for using native HTML title elements when possible.\n\nWAI-ARIA also addresses the need to make frames invisible to assistive technologies, thereby ensuring that all users have a seamless and inclusive web experience. By establishing a set of accessibility guidelines, WAI-ARIA plays a crucial role in making web content and applications more navigable and understandable for individuals with disabilities.\n\nIn summary, WAI-ARIA is a pivotal technical specification that ensures web content and applications are accessible to people with disabilities.
