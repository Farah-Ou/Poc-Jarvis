It is notable for its support for interactivity and animation, making it a versatile choice for web and graphic design. As an XML-based markup language, SVG allows for the description of two-dimensional vector graphics in a text format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. This format is particularly appreciated for its scalability, meaning that SVG images can be zoomed in or out without losing quality. This characteristic is essential for ensuring that graphics look sharp across various devices with different resolutions. SVG's capabilities extend beyond static images; it supports animations and interactive elements, allowing designers to create dynamic and engaging web graphics that enhance user experiences.
