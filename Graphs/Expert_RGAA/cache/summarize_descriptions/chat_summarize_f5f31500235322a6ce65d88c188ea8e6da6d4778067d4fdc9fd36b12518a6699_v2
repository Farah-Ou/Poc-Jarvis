This approach is crucial for individuals who may have difficulties distinguishing colors or are using screen readers, thereby ensuring that all users have equal access to information regardless of their visual capabilities. As a general technique within the WCAG 2.1 framework, G140 plays a vital role in guiding web developers and content creators on how to make their digital content more accessible to a wider range of users, including those with visual impairments.
