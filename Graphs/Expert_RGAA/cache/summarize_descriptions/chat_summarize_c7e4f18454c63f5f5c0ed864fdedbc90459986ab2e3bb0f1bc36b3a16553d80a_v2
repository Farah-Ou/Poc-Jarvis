It functions as a screen reader, utilizing WAI-ARIA roles to enhance the navigation experience across various applications and websites. This technology is not limited to basic text reading; it also supports the accessible name calculation for SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) links, making it easier for users to understand and interact with graphical elements on the web.\n\nAvailable on both Mac OS X and iOS platforms, VOICEOVER is integral for testing accessibility, ensuring that applications and digital content are accessible to all users, including those who rely on screen readers for their interaction with technology. By providing spoken descriptions of what is happening on the screen, VOICEOVER enables users to perform tasks, browse the internet, and manage their devices without needing to see the screen.\n\nThis comprehensive approach to accessibility highlights Apple's commitment to inclusivity, allowing users with visual impairments to experience the full range of functionalities offered by their devices. VOICEOVER's support for advanced features like WAI-ARIA roles and SVG link navigation further cements its position as a leading tool in the realm of assistive technologies.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751293640, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 245, "prompt_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 429, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
