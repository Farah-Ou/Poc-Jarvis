However, it currently presents some limitations in its functionality. Notably, JAWS has incomplete or missing support for the accessible name calculation for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) links. This issue can hinder the ability of users to fully interact with or navigate through web content that employs SVG elements for links, potentially impacting the user experience for individuals relying on this technology for web accessibility.\n\nAdditionally, JAWS offers incomplete support for Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) roles. WAI-ARIA roles are essential for defining the type of user interface elements on web pages, which in turn helps screen readers like JAWS interpret and convey these elements accurately to users. The lack of comprehensive support for WAI-ARIA roles by JAWS affects accessibility navigation, as it may not correctly interpret or announce the roles of certain elements on a webpage. This limitation can further complicate the browsing experience for users with visual impairments, making it challenging for them to understand the structure and navigate the content of complex web pages effectively.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, JAWS remains a critical tool in the field of web accessibility, enabling users with visual impairments to access and interact with digital content. The ongoing development and updates to JAWS are essential for addressing these issues, ensuring that it continues to meet the evolving standards of web accessibility and serves the needs of its users more effectively.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751293640, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 309, "prompt_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 497, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
