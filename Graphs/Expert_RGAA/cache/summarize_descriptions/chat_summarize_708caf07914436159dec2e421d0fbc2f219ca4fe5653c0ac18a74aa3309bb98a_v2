Both of these frameworks aim to align with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, demonstrating a shared commitment to improving access to digital content for all users, including those with disabilities. RGAA 4.1.2, in particular, not only aligns with but also explicitly references EN 301 549 V2.1.2 as a foundational standard within its criteria for web accessibility. This relationship underscores the importance of EN 301 549 V2.1.2 as a benchmark for digital accessibility, which RGAA 4.1.2 incorporates into its accessibility compliance criteria and guidelines. By integrating EN 301 549 V2.1.2 standards, RGAA 4.1.2 ensures that its guidelines are comprehensive and adhere to internationally recognized best practices in digital accessibility. This integration facilitates a unified approach to accessibility, making it easier for organizations to comply with these standards and ultimately making digital environments more accessible to a wider audience.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751293666, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 230, "prompt_tokens": 335, "total_tokens": 565, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
