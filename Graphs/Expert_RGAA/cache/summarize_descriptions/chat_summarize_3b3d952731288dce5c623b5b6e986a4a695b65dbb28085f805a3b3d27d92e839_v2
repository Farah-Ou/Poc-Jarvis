RGAA is a framework that incorporates references to and is based on the guidelines provided by WCAG 2.1, which is a widely recognized international standard for web content accessibility. The purpose of RGAA is to establish legal requirements for digital accessibility in Europe, ensuring that web content is accessible to individuals with disabilities. By using WCAG 2.1 as part of its framework, RGAA aligns with a set of guidelines that aim to make web content more accessible to a wider range of people, including those with disabilities.
