RGAA 4.1.2, a part of a broader set of web accessibility guidelines, specifically includes considerations and guidelines that emphasize the importance of using WAI-ARIA roles and attributes. These guidelines are designed to improve the accessibility of web content for people with disabilities. By recommending the use of WAI-ARIA roles, RGAA 4.1.2 aims to ensure that web elements are more accessible and understandable to assistive technologies, such as screen readers. Additionally, the inclusion of WAI-ARIA attributes as per RGAA 4.1.2's guidelines further supports the creation of a more inclusive and navigable web environment. This synergy between RGAA 4.1.2 and WAI-ARIA highlights the importance of adopting standardized practices to enhance web accessibility effectively.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751293666, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 189, "prompt_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 388, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
