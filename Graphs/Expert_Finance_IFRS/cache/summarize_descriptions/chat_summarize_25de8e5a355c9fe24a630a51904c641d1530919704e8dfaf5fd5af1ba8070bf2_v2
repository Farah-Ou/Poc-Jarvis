This standard sets out the criteria for selecting and changing accounting policies, ensuring that these policies are applied consistently across financial periods and are reflective of the economic reality of the entity's transactions. It also has specific implications for insurance contracts, highlighting its broad applicability across different sectors.\n\nIAS 8 is particularly focused on the treatment of changes in accounting methods, changes in accounting estimates, and errors. It provides a comprehensive framework for entities on how to reflect these changes in their financial statements, ensuring transparency and consistency. This includes detailing how to retrospectively apply changes in accounting policies, unless it is impracticable, and how to account for changes in accounting estimates prospectively. Furthermore, IAS 8 mandates the correction of errors in a way that restates prior period financial statements as if the error had never occurred, unless it is impracticable to determine the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the error.\n\nIn essence, IAS 8 ensures that financial statements are reliable, comparable, and reflect the true financial position and performance of an entity. It emphasizes the importance of consistency in accounting practices and the need for changes in accounting policies or estimates to be made only if they provide a more relevant and reliable representation of the entity's financial situation or performance. Through its comprehensive guidelines, IAS 8 aids entities in making informed decisions about their accounting policies, thereby enhancing the quality and credibility of financial reporting.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751297412, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 320, "prompt_tokens": 237, "total_tokens": 557, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
