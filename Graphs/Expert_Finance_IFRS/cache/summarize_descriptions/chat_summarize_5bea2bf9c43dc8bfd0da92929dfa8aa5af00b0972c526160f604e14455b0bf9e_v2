This standard is applicable to a wide range of transactions, including those with employees or other parties, and covers payments to be settled in various forms such as cash, other assets, or equity instruments of the entity. Specifically, IFRS 2 mandates the accounting for the issuance of shares or share options to employees, ensuring that the financial effects of these transactions are accurately reflected in the entity's net income and financial position. This includes recognizing expenses related to stock options awarded to employees.\n\nThe standard has been in effect for financial years starting from January 1, 2005, and it requires retrospective application for cash-settled transactions that existed at the effective date. By detailing the financial reporting requirements for transactions involving payment based on shares, IFRS 2 aims to improve the transparency and comparability of financial statements by ensuring that the effects of share-based payment transactions are clearly recognized in the net result and financial position of an entity. This comprehensive approach to accounting for share-based payments helps stakeholders better understand the financial implications of these transactions on an entity's performance and financial health.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751297413, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 237, "prompt_tokens": 295, "total_tokens": 532, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
