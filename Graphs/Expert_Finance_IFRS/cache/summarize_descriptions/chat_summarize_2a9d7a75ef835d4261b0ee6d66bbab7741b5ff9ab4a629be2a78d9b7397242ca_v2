This standard is integral to ensuring that entities accurately reflect their investment positions and financial relationships with these entities in their standalone financial statements. Additionally, IAS 27 is mentioned in conjunction with IFRS 11, highlighting its relevance and application in scenarios where early application of IFRS 11 is considered. This connection between IAS 27 and IFRS 11 underscores the importance of applying these standards simultaneously to achieve a comprehensive and accurate representation of an entity's investments in various forms of business arrangements. Through its detailed guidance, IAS 27 facilitates a consistent approach to accounting for such investments, thereby contributing to the transparency and comparability of financial information across different jurisdictions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751297413, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 179, "prompt_tokens": 185, "total_tokens": 364, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
