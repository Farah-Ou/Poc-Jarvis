It meticulously defines what constitutes control, establishing it as the fundamental basis for consolidation. This standard outlines the specific accounting requirements that must be adhered to when preparing consolidated financial statements, ensuring that entities accurately reflect their control over and relationships with other entities in their financial reporting. Additionally, IFRS 10 is designed to be applied simultaneously with IFRS 11, indicating that these standards work in conjunction to provide a comprehensive framework for entities involved in joint arrangements and those that have control over other entities. This simultaneous application ensures that the financial statements of entities provide a clear, consistent, and complete picture of their financial position and performance, especially in the context of their control over and involvement with other entities.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751297413, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 172, "prompt_tokens": 197, "total_tokens": 369, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
