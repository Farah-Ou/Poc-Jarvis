This standard is pivotal for entities holding interests in jointly controlled entities, providing a clear framework for distinguishing between joint ventures and common ventures. It came into effect for financial years starting from January 1, 2013, marking a significant transition in how entities account for their interests in joint arrangements. Prior to IFRS 11, entities might have used proportional consolidation or the equity method for such accounting. However, IFRS 11 introduced new accounting requirements, necessitating entities to reassess and, in many cases, alter their accounting practices for interests in joint arrangements.\n\nThe standard, known in French as \"Norme d'information financière,\" establishes principles for entities that have interests in enterprises controlled jointly, thereby ensuring a consistent approach to the financial reporting of joint arrangements across different jurisdictions. By focusing on the nature of the rights and obligations arising from an arrangement, IFRS 11 requires entities to classify their interests as either joint operations, where the entities have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, or joint ventures, where the entities have rights to the net assets. This classification affects the accounting treatment and disclosure in the financial statements, aiming to provide more relevant and reliable information to stakeholders about the financial impact of an entity's involvement in joint arrangements.\n\nIn summary, IFRS 11 is a comprehensive standard that has reshaped the landscape of accounting for joint arrangements since 2013, emphasizing the importance of the nature of joint arrangements over the legal form, and requiring detailed disclosure to enhance the transparency and comparability of financial statements.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751297413, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 341, "prompt_tokens": 243, "total_tokens": 584, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
