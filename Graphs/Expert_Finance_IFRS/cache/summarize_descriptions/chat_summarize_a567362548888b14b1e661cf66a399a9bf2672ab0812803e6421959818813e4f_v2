It exempts insurers from separating embedded derivatives from the main insurance contract, provided these derivatives are themselves insurance contracts. This standard provides comprehensive guidance on the recognition, measurement, and financial reporting of insurance contracts issued by insurers. It aims at imposing limited improvements to accounting practices while ensuring that the financial statements provide information that helps users understand the cash flows associated with insurance contracts. By addressing the unique nature of insurance contracts and the way they are sold and managed, IFRS 4 plays a crucial role in standardizing insurance contract accounting on a global scale.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751297413, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 147, "prompt_tokens": 252, "total_tokens": 399, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
