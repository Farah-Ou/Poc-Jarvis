IFRS 11, which focuses on joint arrangements, allows for early application provided that IAS 28, which pertains to investments in associates and joint ventures and was amended in 2011, is applied simultaneously. This requirement ensures that entities looking to adopt IFRS 11 ahead of its mandatory implementation date must also apply the amendments made to IAS 28 at the same time. This linkage between the two standards underscores the interconnectedness of the accounting treatments for joint arrangements and investments in associates and joint ventures, ensuring consistency and comparability in financial reporting.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751297426, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 145, "prompt_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 339, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
