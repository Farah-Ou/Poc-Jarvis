This approach emphasizes the importance of providing information that is used internally by an entity's management for decision-making and performance assessment purposes. Specifically, IFRS 8 requires entities to disclose information in their financial statements that enables users to understand the financial impacts of the entity's business activities as well as the economic environments in which the entity operates. This disclosure is aimed at allowing stakeholders to evaluate the performance and strategies of different segments of the business, ensuring transparency and aiding in informed decision-making. Through the adoption of IFRS 8, entities are encouraged to present their financial data in a manner that reflects how the management views and analyzes the business, thereby aligning external financial reporting with internal management reporting.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751297413, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 157, "prompt_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 359, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
