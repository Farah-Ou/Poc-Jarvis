This requirement is designed to enable users of these statements to assess the impact of financial instruments on the entity's financial position and performance effectively. Additionally, IFRS 7 aims to provide insights into the nature and magnitude of risks stemming from financial instruments and the strategies employed by the entity to manage these risks. The standard covers a broad spectrum of disclosures, including but not limited to, risk management strategies related to financial instruments, hedging activities, and the fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities. By adhering to the guidelines set forth by IFRS 7, entities ensure that stakeholders have a clear understanding of how financial instruments are used within the organization, the risks these instruments may pose, and the measures in place to mitigate such risks. This transparency is crucial for investors, creditors, and other users of financial statements in making informed decisions based on the financial health and risk management practices of an entity.\",8\r\n39,IAS 32,,3\r\n58,IAS 19,\"IAS 19 is a standard that outlines the accounting requirements for employee benefits, including short-term benefits, post-employment benefits, other long-term benefits, and termination benefits\",1\r\n56,IAS 16,\"IAS 16 is a standard that provides guidance on the accounting for property, plant, and equipment including the determination of their carrying amounts, depreciation charges, and impairment losses\",1\r\n57,IAS 38,\"IAS 38 is a standard that specifies the accounting treatment for intangible assets that are not dealt with specifically in another IFRS, including the recognition and measurement of intangible assets\",1\r\n30,IFRS 2,\"IFRS 2 is a comprehensive accounting standard that governs the financial reporting of transactions involving share-based payments. This standard is applicable to a wide range of transactions, including those with employees or other parties, and covers payments to be settled in various forms such as cash, other assets, or equity instruments of the entity. Specifically, IFRS 2 mandates the accounting for the issuance of shares or share options to employees, ensuring that the financial effects of these transactions are accurately reflected in the entity's net income and financial position. This includes recognizing expenses related to stock options awarded to employees.\n\nThe standard has been in effect for financial years starting from January 1, 2005, and it requires retrospective application for cash-settled transactions that existed at the effective date. By detailing the financial reporting requirements for transactions involving payment based on shares, IFRS 2 aims to improve the transparency and comparability of financial statements by ensuring that the effects of share-based payment transactions are clearly recognized in the net result and financial position of an entity.
