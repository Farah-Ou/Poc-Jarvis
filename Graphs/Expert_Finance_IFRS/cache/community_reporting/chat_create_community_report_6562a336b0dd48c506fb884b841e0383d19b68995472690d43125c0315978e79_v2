It outlines the specific accounting practices for non-current assets that are being prepared for sale, emphasizing how these assets, along with discontinued operations, should be presented and disclosed within financial statements. The standard mandates a particular approach to recognizing and measuring such assets, ensuring that they are accurately represented in a company's financial documentation. By providing a clear framework for these processes, IFRS 5 plays a vital role in maintaining transparency and consistency in financial reporting, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions based on the financial health and strategic directions of an entity.\",4\r\n18,IFRS 9,\"IFRS 9 is a comprehensive international financial reporting standard that governs all aspects of accounting for financial instruments. It encompasses the classification, measurement, recognition, impairment, and derecognition of financial instruments, along with hedge accounting. This standard is designed to provide a consistent and detailed framework for entities to follow when accounting for financial instruments, ensuring that investments in subsidiaries are measured at fair value for investment entities. By covering a broad spectrum of financial accounting practices, IFRS 9 aims to enhance the transparency and comparability of financial statements across different jurisdictions. It replaces earlier accounting standards for financial instruments, offering a unified approach that addresses previous criticisms and gaps in financial reporting. Through its detailed guidelines, IFRS 9 helps entities to accurately reflect their financial instruments in their financial statements, contributing to more informed decision-making by investors and other stakeholders.\",7\r\n55,IFRS 7,\"IFRS 7 is a comprehensive accounting standard that mandates entities to disclose extensive information about financial instruments within their financial statements. This requirement is designed to enable users of these statements to assess the impact of financial instruments on the entity's financial position and performance effectively. Additionally, IFRS 7 aims to provide insights into the nature and magnitude of risks stemming from financial instruments and the strategies employed by the entity to manage these risks. The standard covers a broad spectrum of disclosures, including but not limited to, risk management strategies related to financial instruments, hedging activities, and the fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities. By adhering to the guidelines set forth by IFRS 7, entities ensure that stakeholders have a clear understanding of how financial instruments are used within the organization, the risks these instruments may pose, and the measures in place to mitigate such risks. This transparency is crucial for investors, creditors, and other users of financial statements in making informed decisions based on the financial health and risk management practices of an entity.\",8\r\n39,IAS 32,,3\r\n24,ENTITÉ D'INVESTISSEMENT,\"L'entité d'investissement, qui obtient des fonds d'investisseurs pour fournir des services de gestion d'investissement, s'engage à générer des rendements pour ses investisseurs principalement via des plus-values en capital ou des revenus d'investissement.

Elle n'est pas requise de présenter des états financiers consolidés, une pratique courante pour de nombreuses entreprises, si elle mesure tous ses filiales à la juste valeur par le biais du résultat. Cela signifie que plutôt que de consolider les résultats financiers de ses filiales avec les siens, l'entité d'investissement évalue ces filiales à leur juste valeur marchande actuelle et reconnaît les gains ou pertes dans ses résultats financiers. La seule exception à cette règle de non-consolidation concerne les filiales qui fournissent des services liés directement aux activités d'investissement de l'entité. Dans un tel cas, la consolidation est nécessaire pour refléter fidèlement la performance et la position financière de l'entité d'investissement.

This standard is applicable to a wide range of transactions, including those with employees or other parties, and covers payments to be settled in various forms such as cash, other assets, or equity instruments of the entity. Specifically, IFRS 2 mandates the accounting for the issuance of shares or share options to employees, ensuring that the financial effects of these transactions are accurately reflected in the entity's net income and financial position. This includes recognizing expenses related to stock options awarded to employees.\n\nThe standard has been in effect for financial years starting from January 1, 2005, and it requires retrospective application for cash-settled transactions that existed at the effective date. By detailing the financial reporting requirements for transactions involving payment based on shares, IFRS 2 aims to improve the transparency and comparability of financial statements by ensuring that the effects of share-based payment transactions are clearly recognized in the net result and financial position of an entity. This comprehensive approach to accounting for share-based payments helps stakeholders better understand the financial implications of these transactions on an entity's performance and financial health.\",5\r\n58,IAS 19,\"IAS 19 is a standard that outlines the accounting requirements for employee benefits, including short-term benefits, post-employment benefits, other long-term benefits, and termination benefits\",1\r\n56,IAS 16,\"IAS 16 is a standard that provides guidance on the accounting for property, plant, and equipment including the determination of their carrying amounts, depreciation charges, and impairment losses\",1\r\n57,IAS 38,\"IAS 38 is a standard that specifies the accounting treatment for intangible assets that are not dealt with specifically in another IFRS, including the recognition and measurement of intangible assets\",1\r\n21,IAS 39,\"A financial instruments standard that IFRS 9 replaced, dealing with recognition, measurement, impairment, and derecognition\",1\r\n41,IFRS 4,\"IFRS 4 is an accounting standard specifically designed for the insurance industry, focusing on the accounting and reporting requirements for insurance contracts within the scope of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

It aims at imposing limited improvements to accounting practices while ensuring that the financial statements provide information that helps users understand the cash flows associated with insurance contracts.
