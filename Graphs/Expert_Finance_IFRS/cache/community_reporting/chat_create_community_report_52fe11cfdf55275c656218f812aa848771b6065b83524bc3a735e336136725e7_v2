This standard is pivotal for entities holding interests in jointly controlled entities, providing a clear framework for distinguishing between joint ventures and common ventures. It came into effect for financial years starting from January 1, 2013, marking a significant transition in how entities account for their interests in joint arrangements. Prior to IFRS 11, entities might have used proportional consolidation or the equity method for such accounting. However, IFRS 11 introduced new accounting requirements, necessitating entities to reassess and, in many cases, alter their accounting practices for interests in joint arrangements.\n\nThe standard, known in French as \"\"Norme d'information financière,\"\" establishes principles for entities that have interests in enterprises controlled jointly, thereby ensuring a consistent approach to the financial reporting of joint arrangements across different jurisdictions. By focusing on the nature of the rights and obligations arising from an arrangement, IFRS 11 requires entities to classify their interests as either joint operations, where the entities have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, or joint ventures, where the entities have rights to the net assets. This classification affects the accounting treatment and disclosure in the financial statements, aiming to provide more relevant and reliable information to stakeholders about the financial impact of an entity's involvement in joint arrangements.\n\nIn summary, IFRS 11 is a comprehensive standard that has reshaped the landscape of accounting for joint arrangements since 2013, emphasizing the importance of the nature of joint arrangements over the legal form, and requiring detailed disclosure to enhance the transparency and comparability of financial statements.\",7\r\n17,IAS 27,\"IAS 27, known as a standard within the International Accounting Standards, plays a crucial role in the financial reporting landscape by outlining the accounting treatment for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates when preparing individual financial statements. This standard is integral to ensuring that entities accurately reflect their investment positions and financial relationships with these entities in their standalone financial statements. Additionally, IAS 27 is mentioned in conjunction with IFRS 11, highlighting its relevance and application in scenarios where early application of IFRS 11 is considered. This connection between IAS 27 and IFRS 11 underscores the importance of applying these standards simultaneously to achieve a comprehensive and accurate representation of an entity's investments in various forms of business arrangements. Through its detailed guidance, IAS 27 facilitates a consistent approach to accounting for such investments, thereby contributing to the transparency and comparability of financial information across different jurisdictions.\",2\r\n28,IAS 28,\"IAS 28, known formally as the International Accounting Standard 28, is a key norm within the framework of international financial reporting standards. It specifically governs the accounting for investments in associates and joint ventures, applying the equity method for such transactions. This standard is often mentioned in conjunction with IAS 27 (Separate Financial Statements), IFRS 10 (Consolidated Financial Statements), and IFRS 12 (Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities), as it is applied simultaneously with IFRS 11 (Joint Arrangements). The integration of IAS 28 with these standards ensures a comprehensive approach to the financial reporting of entities' interests in various forms of business arrangements, highlighting its critical role in the accurate and consistent representation of an entity's financial position and performance in relation to its investments in associates and joint ventures.\",2\r\n26,ENTREPRISE COMMUNE,\"Partenariat où les parties ont des droits sur les actifs et des obligations au titre des passifs, comptabilisant leurs droits et obligations conformément aux IFRS applicables.\",1\r\n27,COENTREPRISE,\"Partenariat où les parties ont des droits sur l'actif net, devant comptabiliser leurs intérêts à titre de participation selon la méthode de la mise en équivalence conformément à IAS 28.\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n19,IFRS 11,IFRS 1,IFRS 1 includes transitional provisions for entities applying IFRS 11 for the first time,15\r\n15,IAS 27,IFRS 1,\"IFRS 1 allows entities to use a cost model based on IAS 27 for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates\",10\r\n29,IFRS 11,IAS 28,\"IFRS 11 and IAS 28 are two accounting standards that are closely related in terms of their application, particularly when it comes to early adoption.

This requirement ensures that entities looking to adopt IFRS 11 ahead of its mandatory implementation date must also apply the amendments made to IAS 28 at the same time.
