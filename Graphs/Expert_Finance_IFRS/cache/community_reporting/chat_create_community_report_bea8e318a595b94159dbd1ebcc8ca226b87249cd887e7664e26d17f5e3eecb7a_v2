Its primary aim is to ensure that the financial information presented by these entities is of high quality, transparent, and comparable across different jurisdictions. This standard is particularly important for entities transitioning to IFRS from another accounting framework, as it provides a structured approach to the adoption process. By following IFRS 1, entities can effectively navigate the complexities of moving to a new accounting standard, ensuring that their financial statements meet global standards for clarity, consistency, and comparability. This facilitates a smoother transition and helps stakeholders, including investors and regulatory bodies, to better understand the financial position and performance of entities new to IFRS.\",8\r\n2,IAS 8,\"IAS 8 is an accounting standard that plays a crucial role in guiding entities on how to develop and apply accounting policies, as well as how to handle changes in accounting estimates and the correction of errors. This standard sets out the criteria for selecting and changing accounting policies, ensuring that these policies are applied consistently across financial periods and are reflective of the economic reality of the entity's transactions. It also has specific implications for insurance contracts, highlighting its broad applicability across different sectors.\n\nIAS 8 is particularly focused on the treatment of changes in accounting methods, changes in accounting estimates, and errors. It provides a comprehensive framework for entities on how to reflect these changes in their financial statements, ensuring transparency and consistency. This includes detailing how to retrospectively apply changes in accounting policies, unless it is impracticable, and how to account for changes in accounting estimates prospectively. Furthermore, IAS 8 mandates the correction of errors in a way that restates prior period financial statements as if the error had never occurred, unless it is impracticable to determine the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the error.\n\nIn essence, IAS 8 ensures that financial statements are reliable, comparable, and reflect the true financial position and performance of an entity. It emphasizes the importance of consistency in accounting practices and the need for changes in accounting policies or estimates to be made only if they provide a more relevant and reliable representation of the entity's financial situation or performance. Through its comprehensive guidelines, IAS 8 aids entities in making informed decisions about their accounting policies, thereby enhancing the quality and credibility of financial reporting.\",3\r\n1,IAS 34,\"IAS 34 pertains to interim financial reporting, guiding entities on how to report financial performance in interim periods\",1\r\n3,ÉTATS FINANCIERS IFRS,,1\r\n16,IAS 21,A standard that deals with foreign exchange rates and their effects on financial statements,1\r\n19,IAS 23,\"A standard that specifies how to treat borrowing costs, particularly the interest expense incurred from constructing a qualifying asset\",1\r\n54,IFRS 6,\"A standard specifying financial reporting for the exploration and evaluation of mineral resources, including accounting practices, depreciation tests, and disclosure of related expenditures\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2,IFRS 1,IAS 8,\"IFRS 1 s'applique aux entités qui adoptent les IFRS pour la première fois, sauf si elles choisissent d'appliquer les IFRS de manière rétrospective selon IAS 8\",11\r\n0,IFRS 1,IAS 34,IFRS 1 applies to entities preparing their first IFRS financial statements and any interim financial reports according to IAS 34,9\r\n1,IFRS 1,ÉTATS FINANCIERS IFRS,IFRS 1 guide les entités dans la préparation de leurs premiers états financiers IFRS,9\r\n14,IAS 21,IFRS 1,IFRS 1 discusses exemptions related to IAS 21 for entities transitioning to IFRS,9\r\n18,IAS 23,IFRS 1,IFRS 1 offers an option to apply IAS 23 borrowing costs from a transition date,9\r\n58,IFRS 6,IAS 8,IFRS 6 provides a temporary exemption from applying certain paragraphs of IAS 8 for developing accounting policies related to the exploration and evaluation of mineral resources,5\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
